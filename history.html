        <h3>Prehistory and Gojoseon</h3>
        <p>The Korean Academy claimed ancient hominid fossils originating from about 100,000 BCE in the lava at a stone
          city site
          in Korea. Fluorescent and high-magnetic analyses indicate the volcanic fossils may be from as early as
          300,000 BCE. The
          best preserved Korean pottery goes back to the paleolithic around 10,000 BCE and the Neolithic period begins
          around 6000 BCE.
          According to legend, Dangun, a descendant of Heaven, established Gojoseon in 2333 BCE. In 108 BCE, the Han
          dynasty defeated. Gojoseon and installed four commanderies in the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the
          commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades, but the Lelang Commandery remained as a center
          of
          cultural and economic exchange with successive Chinese dynasties for four centuries. By 313, Goguryeo annexed
          all of the Chinese commanderies.

        <h3>Proto–Three Kingdoms</h3>
        <p>The Proto–Three Kingdoms period, sometimes called the Multiple States Period, is the earlier part of what is
          commonly called the Three Kingdoms Period, following the fall of Gojoseon but before Gogureo, Baekje, and
          Silla
          fully developed into kingdoms.
          This time period saw numerous states spring up from the former territories of Gojoseon, which encompassed
          northern Korea and southern Manchuria. With the fall of Gojoseon, southern Korea entered the Samhan period.
          Located in the southern part of Korea, Samhan referred to the three confederacies of Manhan, Jinhan and
          Byeonhan. Mahan was the largest and consisted of 54 states. Byeonhan and Jinhan both consisted of twelve
          states,
          bringing a total of 78 states within the Samhan. These three confederacies eventually developed into Baekje,
          Silla and Gaya.

        <h3>Three Kingdoms</h3>
        <p>The Three Kingdoms of Korea consisted of Goguryeo, Silla and Baekje. Silla and Baekje controlled the southern
          half of the Korean Peninsula, maintaining the former Samhan territories, while Goguryeo concrolled the
          northern
          half of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria and the Liaodong Peninsula, uniting Buyeo, Okjeo, Dongye, and the
          other
          states in the former Gojoseon territories.
          Goguryeo was a highly milisaristic state; it was a powerful empire and one of the great powers in East Asia
          reaching its zenith in the 5th century when its territories expanded to encompass most of Manchuria to the
          north, parts of Inner Mongolia to the west, parts of Russia to the east, and the Seoul region to the south.
          Goguryeo experienced a golden age under Gwanggaeto the Great and his son Jangsu, who both subdued Baekje and
          Silla during their times, achieving a brief unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea and becoming the most
          dominant power on the Korean Peninsula. In addition to contesting for control of the Korean Peninsula,
          Goguryeo
          had many military conflicts with various Chinese dynasties, most notably the Goguryeo-Sui War, in which
          Goguryeo
          defeated a huge force said to number over a million men. In 642, the powerful general Yeon Gaesomun led a coup
          and gained complete control over Goguryeo. In response, Emperor Tang Taizong of China led a campaign against
          Goguryeo, but was defeated and retreated. After the death of Tang Taizong, his son Emperor Tang Gaozong allied
          with the Korean kingdom of Silla and invaded Goguryeo again, but was unable to overcome Goguryeo's stalwart
          defenses and was defeated in 662. However, Yeon Gaesomun died of a natural cause in 666 and Goguryeo was
          thrown
          into chaos and weakened by a succession struggle among his sons and younger brother, with his eldest son
          defecting to Tang and his younger brother defecting to Silla. The Tang-Silla alliance finally conquered
          Goguryeo
          in 668. After the collapse of Goguryeo, Tang and Silla ended their alliance and fought over control of the
          Korean Peninsula. Silla succeeded in gaining control over most of the Korean Peninsula, while Tang gained
          control over Goguryeo's northern territories.
          <br><br>
          However, 30 years after the fall of Goguryeo, a Goguryeo general
          by the name of Dae Joyeong founded the Korean-Mohe state of Balhae and successfully expelled the Tang presence
          from much of the former Goguryeo territories.

          The southwestern Korean kingdom of Baekje was founded around modern-day Seoul by a Goguryeo prince, a son of
          the
          founder of Goguryeo. Baekje absorbed all of the Mahan states and subjugated most of the western Korean
          peninsula
          (including the modern provinces of Gyeonggi, Chungcheong, and Jeolla, as well as parts of Hwanghae and
          Gangwon)
          to a centralised government; during the expansion of its territory, Baekje acquired Chinese culture and
          technology through maritime contacts with the Southern Dynasties. Baekje was a great maritime power; its
          nautical skill, which made it the Phoenicia of East Asia, was instrumental in the dissemination of Buddhism
          throughout East Asia and continental culture to Japan. Historic evidence suggests that Japanese culture, art,
          and language were influenced by the kingdom of Baekje and Korea itself; Baekje also played an important role
          in
          transmitting advanced Chinese culture to the Japanese archipelago. Baekje was once a great military power on
          the
          Korean Peninsula, most notably in the 4th century during the rule of Geunchogo Liaoxi and Shandong in China,
          taking advantage of the weakened state of Former Qin, and Kyushu in the Japanese archipelago; however, Baekje
          was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto the Great and declined.
          Although later records claim that Silla was the oldest of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, it is now believed to
          have been the last kingdom to develop. By the 2nd century, Silla existed as a large state in the southeast,
          occupying and influencing its neighboring city-states. In 562, Silla annexed the Gaya confederacy, which was
          located between Baekje and Silla. The Three Kingdoms of Korea often warred with each other and Silla was often
          dominated by Baekje and Goguryeo. Silla was the smallest and weakest of the three, but it used cunning
          diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and
          eventually Tang China, to its great advantage. In 660, King Muyeol ordered his armies to attack Baekje.
          General
          Kim Yu-shin, aided by Tang forces, conquered Baekje after defeating General Gyebaek at the Battle of
          Hwangsanbeol. In 661, Silla and Tang attacked Goguryeo but were repelled. King Munmu, son of Muyeol and nephew
          of General Kim Yu-shin, launched another campaign in 667 and Goguryeo fell in the following year.

        <h3>North-South States Period</h3>
        <p>Beginning in the 6th century, Sills's power gradually extended across the Korean Peninsula. Silla first
          annexed
          the adjacent Gaya confederacy in 562. By the 640s, Silla formed an alliance with the Tang dynasty of China to
          conquer Baekje and later Goguryeo. After conquering Baekje and Goguryeo, Silla repulsed Tang China from the
          Korean peninsula in 676. Even though Silla unified most of the Korean Peninsula, most of the Goguryeo
          territories to the north of the Korean Peninsula were ruled by Balhae. Former Goguryeo general or chief of
          Sumo
          Mohe Dae Jo-yeong led a group of Goguryeo and Mohe refugees to the Jilin and founded the kingdom of Balhae, 30
          years after the collapse of Goguryeo, as the successor to Goguryeo. At its height, Balhae's territories
          extended
          from southern Manchuria down to the northern Korean peninsula. Balhae was called the "Prosperous Country in
          the
          East".
          Later Silla carried on the maritime prowess of Baekje, which acted like the Phoenicia of medieval East Asia,
          and
          during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between China, Korea and Japan,
          most notably during the time of Jang Bogo; in addition, Silla people made overseas communities in China on the
          Shandong Peninsula and the mouth of the Yangtze River. Later Silla was a prosperous and wealthy country, and
          its
          metropolitan capital of Gyeongju was the fourth largest city in the world. Later Silla was a golden age of art
          and culture, as evidenced by the Hwangnyongsa, Seokguram, Emille Bell. Buddhism flourished during this time,
          and
          many Korean Buddhists gained great fame among Chinese Buddhists and contributed to Chinese Buddhism,
          including:
          Woncheok, Wonhyo, Uisang, Musang, and Kim Gyo-gak, Silla prince whose influence made Mount Jiuhua one of the
          Four Sacred Mountains of Chinese Buddhism.
          Later Silla fell apart in the late 9th century, giving way to the tumultuous Later Three Kingdoms period
          (892–935), and Balhae was destroyed by the Khitans in 926. Goryeo unified the Later Three Kingdoms and
          received
          the last crown prince and much of the ruling class of Balhae, thus bringing about a unification of the two
          successor nations of Goguryeo.

        <h3>Goryeo Dynasty</h3>
        <p>Goryeo was founded in 918 and replaced Silla as the ruling dynasty of Korea. Goryeo's land was at first what
          is
          now South Korea and about 1/3 of North Korea, but later on managed to recover most of the Korean peninsula.
          Momentarily, Goryeo advanced to parts of Jiandao while conquering the Jurchens, but returned the territories
          due
          to the harsh climate and difficulties in defending them. The name "Goryeo" is a short form of "Goguryeo" and
          was
          first used during the time of King Jangsu. Goryeo regarded itself as the successor of Goguryeo, hence its name
          and efforts to recover the former territories of Goguryeo. Wang Geon, the founder of Goryeo, was of Goguryeo
          descent and traced his ancestry to a noble Goguryeo clan. He made Kaesong, his hometown, the capital.
          During this period, laws were codified and a civil service system was introduced. Buddhism flourished and
          spread
          throughout the peninsula. The development of celadon industries flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries. The
          publication of the Tripitaka Koreana onto more than 80,000 wooden blocks and the invention of the world's
          first
          metal movable type in the 13th century attest to Goryeo's cultural achievements.
          Goryeo had to defend frequently against attacks by nomadic empires, especially the Khitans and the Mongols.
          Goryeo had a hostile relationship with the Khitans, because the Khitan Empire had destroyed Balhae, also a
          successor state of Goguryeo. In 993, the Khitans, who had established the Liao dynasty in 907, invaded Goryeo,
          demanding that it make amity with them. Goryeo sent the diplomat Seo Hui to negotiate, who successfully
          persuaded the Khitans to let Goryeo expand to the banks of the Amnok (Yalu) River, citing that in the past the
          land belonged to Goguryeo, the predecessor of Goryeo.
          <br><br>
          During the Goryeo-Khitan War, the Khitan Empire invaded
          Korea twice more in 1009 and 1018, but was defeated.
          After defeating the Khitan Empire, which was the most powerful empire of its time, Goryeo experienced a golden
          age that lasted a century, during which the Tripitaka Koreana was completed, and there were great developments
          in printing and publishing, promoting learning and dispersing knowledge on philosophy, literature, religion,
          and
          science; by 1100, there were 12 universities that produced famous scholars and scientists.
          Goryeo was invaded by the Mongols in seven major campaigns from the 1230s until the 1270s, but was never
          conquered. Exhausted after decades of fighting, Goryeo sent its crown prince to the Yuan capital to swear
          allegiance to the Mongols; Kublai Khan accepted, and married one of his daughters to the Korean crown prince,
          and the dynastic line of Goryeo continued to survive under the overlordship of the Mongol Yuan dynasty as a
          semi-autonomous vassal state and compulsory ally. The two nations became intertwined for 80 years as all
          subsequent Korean kings married Mongol princesses, and the last empress of the Yuan dynasty was a Korean
          princess.
          In the 1350s, King Gongmin was free at last to reform the Goryeo government when the Yuan dynasty began to
          crumble. Gongmin had various problems that needed to be dealt with, which included the removal of pro-Mongol
          aristocrats and military officials, the question of land holding, and quelling the growing animosity between
          the
          Buddhists and confucian scholars. During this tumultuous period, Goryeo momentarily conquered Liaoyang in
          1356,
          repulsed two large invasions by the Red Turbans in 1359 and 1360, and defeated the final attempt by the Yuan
          to
          dominate Goryeo when General Choe Yeong defeated a Mongol tumen in 1364. During the 1380s, Goryeo turned its
          attention to the Wokou threat and used naval artillery created by Choe Museon to annihilate hundreds of pirate
          ships.

        <h3>Joseon Dynasty</h3>
        <p>In 1392, the general Yi Seong-gye overthrew the Goryeo dynasty after he staged a coup and defeated General
          Choe
          Yeong. Yi Seong-gye named his new dynasty Joseon and moved the capital from Kaesong to Hanseong (formerly
          Hanyang; modern-day Seoul) and built the Gyeongbokgung palace. In 1394, he adopted Confucianism as the
          country's
          official ideology, resulting in much loss of power and wealth by the Buddhists. The prevailing philosophy of
          the
          Joseon dynasty was Neo-Confucianism, which was epitomized by the seonbi class, scholars who passed up
          positions
          of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity.
          Joseon was a nominal tributary state of China but exercised full sovereignty, and maintained the highest
          position among China's tributary states, which also included countries such as the Ryukyu Kingdom, Vietnam,
          Burma, Brunei, Laos, Thailand, and the Philippines, among others. In addition, Joseon received tribute from
          Jurchens and Japanese until the 17th century, and had a small enclave in the Ryukyu Kingdom that engaged in
          trade with Siam and Java.
          During the 15th and 16th centuries, Joseon enjoyed many benevolent rulers who promoted education and science.
          Most notable among them was Sejong the Great (r. 1418–50), who personally created and promulgated Hangul, the
          Korean alphabet. This golden age saw great cultural and scientific advancements, including in printing,
          meteorological observation, astronomy, calendar science, ceramics, military technology, geography,
          cartography,
          medicine, and agricultural technology, some of which were unrivaled elsewhere.
          <br><br>
          Joseon implemented a class
          system
          that consisted of yangban the noble class, jungin the middle class, yangin the common class, and cheonin the
          lowest class, which included occupations such as butchers, tanners, shamans, entertainers, and nobi, the
          equivalent of slaves, bondservants, or serfs.
          In 1592 and again in 1597, the Japanese invaded Korea; the Korean military at the time was unprepared and
          untrained, due to two centuries of peace on the Korean Peninsula. Toyotomi Hideyoshi intended to conquer China
          and India through the Korean Peninsula, but was defeated by strong resistance from the Righteous Army, the
          naval
          superiority of Admiral Yi Sun-sin and his turtle ships, and assistance from Wanli Emperor of Ming China.
          However, Joseon experienced great destruction, including a tremendous loss of cultural sites such as temples
          and
          palaces to Japanese pillaging, and the Japanese brought back to Japan an estimated 100,000–200,000 noses cut
          from Korean victims. Less than 30 years after the Japanese invasions, the Manchus took advantage of Joseon's
          war-weakened state and invaded in 1627 and 1637, and then went on to conquer the destabilized Ming dynasty.
          After normalizing relations with the new Qing dynasty, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace.
          Kings Yeongjo and Jeongjo led a new renaissance of the Joseon dynasty during the 18th century.
          In the 19th century, the royal in-law families gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption
          and
          weakening of the state, with severe poverty and peasant rebellions spreading throughout the country.
          Furthermore, the Joseon government adopted a strict isolationist policy, earning the nickname "the hermit
          kingdom", but ultimately failed to protect itself against imperialism and was forced to open its borders,
          beginning an era leading into Japanese imperial rule.

        <h3>Korean Empire</h3>
        <p>Beginning in 1871, Japan began to exert more influence in Korea, forcing it out of China's traditional sphere
          of influence. As a result of the Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), the Qing dynasty had to give up such a position
          according to Article 1 of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which was concluded between China and Japan in 1895. That
          same year, Empress Myeongseong of Korea was assassinated by Japanese agents.
          In 1897, the Joseon dynasty proclaimed the Korean Empire (1897–1910). King Gojong became emperor. During this
          brief period, Korea had some success in modernizing the military, economy, real property laws, education
          system,
          and various industries. Russia, Japan, France, and the United States all invested in the country and sought to
          influence it politically.
          In 1904, the Russo-Japanese War pushed the Russians out of the fight for Korea. Korea became a protectorate of
          Japan the following year. In Manchuria on 26 October 1909, An Jung-geun assassinated the former
          Resident-General
          of Korea, Itō Hirobumi, for his role in trying to force Korea into occupation.

        <h3>Japanese Occupation and Japan-Korea Annexation</h3>
        <p>In 1910, an already militarily occupied Korea was a forced party to the Japan–Korea Annexation Treaty. The
          treaty was signed by Lee Wan-Yong, who was given the General Power of Attorney by the Emperor. However, the
          Emperor is said to have not actually ratified the treaty according to Yi Tae-jin. There is a long dispute
          whether this treaty was legal or illegal due to its signing under duress, threat of force and bribes.
          Korean resistance to the brutal Japanese occupation was manifested in the nonviolent March 1st Movement of
          1919,
          during which 7,000 demonstrators were killed by Japanese police and military. The Korean liberation movement
          also spread to neighbouring Manchuria and Siberia.
          Over five million Koreans were conscripted for labour beginning in 1939, and tens of thousands of men were
          forced into Japan's military. Nearly 400,000 Korean labourers died. Approximately 200,000 girls and women,
          mostly from China and Korea, were forced into sexual slavery for the Japanese military. In 1993, Japanese
          Chief
          Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono acknowledged the terrible injustices faced by these euphemistically named
          "comfort
          women".
          During the Japanese annexation, the Korean language was suppressed in an effort to eradicate Korean national
          identity. Koreans were forced to take Japanese surnames, known as Sōshi-kaimei. Traditional Korean culture
          suffered heavy losses, as numerous Korean cultural artifacts were destroyed or taken to Japan. To this day,
          valuable Korean artifacts can often be found in Japanese museums or among private collections. One
          investigation
          by the South Korean government identified 75,311 cultural assets that were taken from Korea, 34,369 in Japan
          and
          17,803 in the United States. However, experts estimate that over 100,000 artifacts actually remain in Japan.
          Japanese officials considered returning Korean cultural properties, but to date this has not occurred. Korea
          and
          Japan still dispute the ownership of the Dokdo islets, located east of the Korean Peninsula.
          There was significant emigration to the overseas territories of the Empire of Japan during the Japanese
          occupation period, including Korea. By the end of World War II, there were over 850,000 Japanese settlers in
          Korea. After World War II, most of these overseas Japanese repatriated to Japan. Migrants who remained
          squatted
          in informal settlements.

        <h3>Division</h3>
        <p>In 1945, with the surrender of Japan, the United Nations developed plans for a trusteeship administration,
          the
          Soviet Union administering the peninsula north of the 38th parallel and the United States administering the
          south. The politics of the Cold War resulted in the 1948 establishment of two separate governments, North
          Korea
          and South Korea.
          The aftermath of World War II left Korea partitioned along the 38th parallel on 2 September 1945, with the
          north
          under Soviet occupation and the south under US occupation supported by other allied states. Consequently,
          North
          Korea, a Soviet-style socialist republic was established in the north and South Korea; a Western-style regime,
          was established in the South.
          North Korea is a one-party state, now centred on Kim Il-sung's Juche ideology, with a centrally planned
          industrial economy. South Korea is a multi-party state with a capitalist market economy, alongside membership
          in
          the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Group of Twenty. The two states have
          greatly
          diverged both culturally and economically since their partition, though they still share a common traditional
          culture and pre-Cold War history.
          Since the 1960s, the South Korean economy has grown enormously and the economic structure was radically
          transformed. In 1957, South Korea had a lower per capita GDP than Ghana, and by 2008 it was 17 times as high
          as
          Ghana's.
          According to R. J. Rummel, forced labor, executions, and concentration camps were responsible for over one
          million deaths in North Korea from 1948 to 1987; others have estimated 400,000 deaths in concentration camps
          alone. Estimates based on the most recent North Korean census suggest that 240,000 to 420,000 people died as a
          result of the 1990s famine and that there were 600,000 to 850,000 unnatural deaths in North Korea from 1993 to
          2008. In South Korea, as guerrilla activities expanded, the South Korean government used strong measures
          against
          peasants, such as forcefully moving their families from guerrilla areas. According to one estimate, these
          measures resulted in 36,000 people killed, 11,000 people wounded, and 432,000 people displaced.

        <h3>Korean War and Peace</h3>
        <p>The Korean War broke out when Soviet-backed North Korea invaded South Korea, though neither side gained much
          territory as a result. The Korean Peninsula remained divided, the Korean Demilitarized Zone being the de facto
          border between the two states.
          In June 1950 North Korea invaded the South, using Soviet tanks and weaponry. During the Korean War (1950–53)
          more than 1.2 million people died and the three years of fighting throughout the nation effectively destroyed
          most cities. The war ended in an Armistice Agreement at approximately the Military Demarcation Line, but the
          two
          governments are officially at war. In 2018, the leaders of North Korea and South Korea officially signed the
          Panmunjom Declaration, announcing that they will work to end the conflict.
          In November 2020, South Korea and China agreed to work together to mend South Korea's relationship with North
          Korea. During a meeting between President Moon and China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, Moon expressed his gratitude
          to China for its role in helping to foster peace in the Korean Peninsula. Moon was quoted telling Wang during
          their meeting that “[the South Korean] government will not stop efforts to put an end (formally) to war on the
          Korean Peninsula and achieve complete denuclearization and permanent peace together with the international
          community, including China.”
