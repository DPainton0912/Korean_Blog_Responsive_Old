        <h2>Mass media in North Korea</h2>
        <p>The mass media in North Korea is amongst the most strictly controlled in the world. The constitution
          nominally
          provides
          for freedom of speech and the press. However, the government prohibits the exercise of these rights in coming
          in
          and out
          of the country but seeks to mold information at its source. A typical example of this was the death of Kim
          Jong-il, news
          of which was not divulged until two days after it occurred. Kim Jong-un, who replaced his father as the
          leader,
          has given
          every indication he will largely follow in his father's footsteps. However, new technologies are being made
          more
          freely
          available in the country. State-run media outlets are setting up websites, while mobile phone ownership in the
          country
          has escalated rapidly. “There is no country which monopolizes and controls successfully the internet and
          information as
          North Korea does,” said Kang Shin-sam, an expert on North Korean technology and co-head of the International
          Solidarity
          for Freedom of Information in North Korea, a nonprofit based in South Korea. North Korea now has about four
          million mobile-phone
          subscribers—roughly one-sixth of the population and four times the number in 2012, according to an estimate by
          Kim Yon-ho,
          a senior researcher at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies.
          Reporters Without Borders has consistently ranked North Korea at or near the bottom of its yearly Press
          Freedom
          Index since it was first issued in 2002. The latest report, published in 2020, puts North Korea at the 180th
          slot just below Turkmenistan, which is the lowest possible. The state news agencies are the only outlets in
          North Korea.

        <h2>Press freedom</h2>
        <p>Article 67 of the North Korean Constitution protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press. In practice,
          however, the press is tightly controlled by the state, and the government only allows speech that supports it
          and the ruling Workers' Party of Korea. As of 2020, North Korea occupies the last place on Reporters Without
          Borders' annual Press Freedom Index.
          The late Kim Jong-il's book, The Great Teacher of Journalists, advises that "newspapers carry articles in
          which
          they unfailingly
          hold the president in high esteem, adore him and praise him as the great revolutionary leader". Media reports
          in
          North
          Korea are often one-sided and exaggerated, playing "little or no role in gathering and disseminating vital
          information
          true to facts" and providing propaganda for the regime. All North Korean journalists are members of the
          Workers'
          Party.
          Candidates for journalism school must not only prove themselves ideologically clean but also come from
          politically reliable
          families. Journalists who do not follow the strict laws face punishment in the form of hard labour or
          imprisonment, even
          for the smallest typing errors. Only news that favours the regime is permitted, whilst news that covers the
          economic and
          political problems in the country, or criticisms of the regime from abroad is not allowed. Domestic media and
          the population
          itself are not allowed to carry or read stories by foreign media and can be punished for doing so.
          Restrictions
          are also
          placed on the foreign journalists that are allowed into the country under supervision, though many are not
          permitted to
          enter. All the information gathered by newspapers and magazines is disseminated by the main news agency, KCNA.
          No private
          press exists. The media effectively paints the country in a positive light, describing itself as "paradise on
          earth".
          With this, it encourages the population to adopt the "socialist lifestyle"—on one occasion an intensive media
          campaign
          was launched against men with long hair, claiming it reduces intelligence.</p>

        <h2>Cult of personality</h2>
        <p>The media have consistently upheld the personality cult of the Kim family since the country's formation. It
          frequently
          reported on the activities of late leader Kim Jong-il, regularly reporting on his daily activities, including
          "prayers"
          to founding leader Kim Il-sung. Previously, media would refer to Kim Jong-il as the "Dear Leader", though this
          was dropped
          in 2004. However, in January 1981, during the first few months of Kim Jong-il's entry into politics, a survey
          revealed
          economic concerns in the media, rather than upholding the cult—60% to 70% of media coverage was focused on the
          economy
          in January that year, and between January and September, 54% of editorials in the Rodong Sinmun also referred
          to
          economic
          problems, with only 20% on politics, 10% on reunification and 4% on foreign affairs. All indications are that
          this has
          continued under the country's third and current leader, Kim Jong-un; soon after his father's death he was
          acclaimed as
          the "Great Successor". Approximately 90% of airtime on international news broadcasts in North Korea is
          propaganda spent
          describing the publication of works by Kim Jong-il and showing various study groups in foreign countries, to
          allegedly
          mislead the North Korean public as to the outside world's perceptions of the country. When Kim Jong-il visited
          Russia
          in August 2001, official DPRK media reported Russians as being "awestruck" by the encounter, revering Kim
          Jong-il's ability
          to "stop the rain and make the sun come out".</p>
      </article>

      <article class="blogposts">
        <h2>Domestic and international coverage</h2>
        <p>The media is used to promote contrasting domestic and international agendas. Kim Il-Sung was said to
          recognise
          its power
          to influence North Koreans and confuse the outside world. Often, the news is released to the international
          community and
          withheld from the domestic North Korean population, and other news is released domestically but not
          internationally. Though
          some international news coverage is given in DPRK media, much is ignored, is mentioned very briefly, or is
          announced several
          days after the event, as was the case with the Ryongchon disaster in 2004. Reports are also notoriously
          secretive. The
          media remained silent on domestic issues, by not reporting on economic reforms introduced by the government
          such
          as increasing
          wages and food prices, rarely mentioning Kim Jong-il until his first party position in 1980 and the launching
          of
          missiles.
          Restrictions on the dissemination of information do not only apply to the civilian population but North Korean
          officials
          themselves, depending on ranking. In contrast, the idea of reunification of the two Koreas is a pervasive
          theme
          in the
          North Korean media, as is the near-constant "threat" of an "imminent attack" by the foreign countries. In
          recent
          years,
          the media describes in detail satellite launches launched by the country as a sign of the DPRK's "economic
          prowess." The
          media rarely reports bad news from the country; however on one rare occasion, the press acknowledged a famine
          and food
          shortages in the 1990s. It has had a role in supporting anti-government demonstrations in South Korea; in the
          late 1980s,
          it launched a propaganda campaign urging South Koreans to "fight against the 'government' without concessions
          and compromise",
          using false claims to portray the demonstrations as fighting for communism, which, rather, were in support of
          liberal
          democracy. It continues to support South Korean anti-government groups, quoting relevant societies and unions
          critical
          of the government policy and denouncing government "crackdowns", calling for freedom of expression and
          democracy
          for South
          Korean citizens. From January 1 to June 22, 2009, North Korean media was reported to have criticised the South
          Korean
          president 1,700 times — an average of 9.9 times daily. During the Khrushchev era of the Soviet Union when
          relations were
          tense, North Korean media would openly reprint articles critical of the USSR, often written by North Korean
          officials.
          However, once relations between the DPRK and the Soviet Union improved, the articles would no longer appear.
          In
          the following
          years, both North Korean and Soviet media would play down sensitive anniversaries.</p>

        <h2>Newspapers</h2>
        <p>North Korea has 12 principal newspapers and 20 major periodicals, all published in Pyongyang. Foreign
          newspapers are
          not sold on the streets of the capital. Every year, North Korean press jointly publishes a New Year editorial,
          also broadcast
          by KCNA, which regularly attracts the attention of the international news media. Newspapers include:
        <ul>
          <li>Rodong Sinmun (Labour Daily) – (Central Committee of the WPK)</li>
          <li>Joson Inmingun (Korean People's Army Daily)</li>
          <li>Minju Choson (Democratic Korea) – government organ</li>
          <li>Rodongja Sinmun (Workers' Newspaper)</li>
          <li>The Pyongyang Times (English-language; published in the capital)</li>
        </ul>Several newspaper journalists from North Korea were secretly trained in China to covertly report on events
        inside
        North Korea. November 2007 marked the first publication of the Rimjingang magazine, which is distributed
        secretly
        in North
        Korea and neighbouring countries. The magazine covers the economic and political situation in the country. The
        journalists
        have also provided footage of public executions to South Korean and Japanese media.</p>

        <h2>Photojournalism</h2>
        <p>Photojournalism is heavily regulated by the government. Due to the extremely limited flow of information out
          of
          the
          country, there is no consensus over what rules are actually in place to govern photojournalism by members of
          foreign press
          services. The government-owned Korean Central News Agency employs many photojournalists and photo editors.
          North
          Korean
          leaders believe that their rules and censorship system is necessary in order to keep people under control, "to
          prevent
          the rise of criticism about the government."</p>

        <h2>Television and radio</h2>
        <p>Television broadcasting is managed by the Central Broadcasting Committee of Korea (until 2009 called Radio
          and
          Television
          Committee of the DPRK). Radio and TV sets in North Korea are supplied pre-tuned to North Korean stations and
          must be checked
          and registered with the police, though some North Koreans own Chinese radios which can receive foreign
          stations.
          It is
          prohibited to tune into foreign broadcasts. There are four major television stations: Korean Central
          Television,
          Ryongnamsan
          TV (former Korean Educational and Cultural Network), Kaesong Television (which targets South Korea)
          and Sport
          Television (since August 15, 2015 State television is always off-air until its 5:00 pm evening news
          broadcast, except
          on weekends, which start at 6:00 am, and in emergency events, live events and national holidays. In August
          2016,
          North
          Korea introduced an over-the-top streaming service known as Manbang (meaning "everywhere" or "every
          direction"),
          which
          carries live TV (including educational station Mansudae Television), on-demand video, and newspaper articles
          (from the
          state newspaper Rodong Sinmun) over the internet. KCTV described the service as a "respite from radio
          interference". North
          Korean newscasts are known for their showmanship. KCTV's principal newsreader from 1974 to 2012, Ri Chun-hee,
          was well
          known for the wavering, exuberant tone she used when praising the nation's leaders and the hateful one she
          used
          in denouncing
          countries seen as hostile to the regime. Some North Korean journalists who have defected to the South have
          noted
          the contrasts
          with the more conversational South Korean broadcasting style. All broadcast media in some way promotes the
          regime's ideologies
          and positions, such as Juche, and regularly condemns actions by South Korea, Japan, China, Israel, the United
          States,
          and other nations. The media in recent years condemns the United Nations, and its position against the
          country's
          nuclear
          program. Media is generally without adverts, though some advertisement of local brands occurs on Mansudae
          Television.<br><br>
          Due to the economic conditions in the country and the short broadcast day, radio is the most widely used
          medium.
          In 2006,
          there were 16 AM, 14 FM, and 11 shortwave radio broadcast stations. The main radio stations are the Pyongyang
          FM
          Station,
          Voice of Korea, and the Korean Central Broadcasting Station. There is also a black propaganda station called
          Propaganda
          Radio – which purports to be broadcasting from South Korea. Some foreign broadcast radio stations that target
          North Korea
          are often jammed, though this can vary. The authorities designate such foreign media as "enemies of the
          regime".
          Some
          particularly politically sensitive material is available only through wired radio connections. The system was
          likely built
          with infrastructure imported from the Soviet Union, which operated a similar system known as radiotochka
          ("radio
          socket"
          in English). The cable radio transmissions are known by North Koreans as the "Third Broadcast" or the 'Third
          Network.
          It was reported that the third network was complete in 1982. After Kim Jong-un's stated the intention of
          improving 'wire
          broadcasting', the third network has seen installation in new apartment units, although in the 90s,
          distribution
          cables
          were apparently plundered for scrap metal. Similar to the Soviet wired radio system the radio sets are
          technologically
          simple affairs with few electronic components inside them besides a loudspeaker and a control coil for the
          volume, they
          have no "off" switch but can be unplugged. South Korean television programmes cannot be received in North
          Korea
          due to
          incompatibilities between the television systems (PAL in North Korea and NTSC/ATSC in South Korea) and the
          sets
          being
          pre-tuned. South Korean soap operas, films and Western Hollywood films according to defectors, are said to be
          spreading
          at a "rapid rate" throughout North Korea despite the threat of punishment; As of 2011, USB flash drives were
          selling well
          in North Korea, primarily used for watching South Korean dramas and films on personal computers. North Korean
          broadcasts
          have been picked up in South Korea, and are monitored by the Unification Ministry in Seoul, which handles
          cross-border
          relations and media exchanges. Defectors are also streaming North Korean television broadcasts on the
          Internet.

        <h2>Internet</h2>
        <p>Internet access in North Korea is restricted to Internet cafés or hotels designated for foreign tourists in
          Pyongyang,
          and is limited for North Koreans to essential users like international businesses. Nearly all of North Korea's
          Internet
          traffic is routed through China. The general population of North Korea does not have internet access, however,
          they do
          have access to Kwangmyong, an intranet set up by the government. North Korea itself has a limited presence on
          the internet,
          with several sites on their national .kp domain. The Mosquito Net filtering model used in North Korea attempts
          to attract
          foreign investment, while the filter simultaneously blocks foreign ideas.</p>

        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>In September 2019 state-run media announced the release of a motion-based video game system named the

          system appears to exhibit similar features to the Nintendo Wii and PlayStation Move. The system has two wands
          similar
          in appearance to Wii controllers, a motion detector similar in appearance to the Kinect, and a sensor-based

        <h2>Access to foreign media</h2>
        <p>Despite extremely strict regulations and draconian penalties, North Koreans, particularly elite citizens,
          have
          increasing
          access to news and other media outside the state-controlled media authorized by the government. While access
          to
          the internet
          is tightly controlled, radio, DVDs, and USB drives are common media accessed, and in border areas, television.
          Penalties
          vary depending on the source of the media; being found with South Korean media may be punished more harshly
          than
          access
          to Chinese media. One estimate is that approx. 92% of North Koreans access foreign media at least once a
          month.

        <h2>Mass media in South Korea</h2>
        <p>The South Korean mass media consist of several different types of public communication of news: television,
          radio, cinema,
          newspapers, magazines, and Internet-based websites. Modern Korean journalism began after the opening of Korea
          in
          the late
          19th century. The Korean press had a strong reformist and nationalistic flavour from the beginning, but faced
          efforts
          at political control or outright censorship during most of the 20th century.</p>

      <article class="blogposts">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Colonial period (1910–1945)</h3>
        <p>When the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty was signed in 1910, the Governor-General of Korea assumed direct
          control
          of the
          press along with other public institutions. Following the March 1st Movement in 1919, the colonial government
          loosened
          their overt control over cultural activities and permitted several Korean newspapers to function while
          maintaining some
          behind-the-scenes direction over politically sensitive topics. During the 1920s, Korean vernacular newspapers,
          such as
          Donga Ilbo, and intellectual journals such as Kaebyok (Creation), conducted running skirmishes with Japanese
          censors.
          Colonial authorities prohibited sales of individual issues on hundreds of occasions between 1926 and 1932.
          World
          War II
          mobilisation in the ensuing years ended any resemblance of autonomy for the Korean press; all Korean-language
          publications
          were outlawed in 1941.</p>
        <h3>After World War II (1945–1990)</h3>
        <p>Following the period of 1945 to 1948, which saw a burgeoning of newspapers and periodicals of every
          description
          as well
          as occasional censorship of the media, almost all subsequent South Korean governments have at times attempted
          to
          control
          the media. Syngman Rhee's government continued the military government's Ordinance Number Eighty-Eight, which
          outlawed
          leftist newspapers. Rhee also closed moderate newspapers and arrested reporters and publishers on numerous
          occasions between
          1948 and 1960. On taking power in 1961, Park Chung-hee's Supreme Council for National Reconstruction closed
          all
          but fifteen
          of Seoul's 64 daily newspapers and refused to register a comparable percentage of the country's news services,
          weeklies,
          and monthly publications while using its own radio and news agencies to promote its official line. The Park
          government
          also used the Press Ethics Commission Law of 1964 and, after 1972, emergency decrees that penalised criticism
          of
          the government
          to keep the media in line. In 1974, the government ordered a number of journalists fired and used the KCIA to
          force Dong-a
          Ilbo to stop its reporting on popular opposition to the Park government by intimidating the paper's
          advertisers.
          During
          the Park and the subsequent Chun Doo-hwan administrations, the government exercised considerable control and
          surveillance
          over the media through the comprehensive National Security Act. In late 1980, the Chun government established
          more thorough
          control of the news media than had existed in the South Korea since the Korean War. Independent news agencies
          were absorbed
          into a single state-run agency, numerous provincial newspapers were closed, central newspapers were forbidden
          to
          station
          correspondents in provincial cities, the Christian Broadcasting System network was forbidden to provide news
          coverage,
          and two independent broadcasting companies were absorbed into the state-run Korean Broadcasting System (KBS).
          In
          addition,
          the Defense Security Command, then commanded by Roh Tae Woo, and the Ministry of Culture and Information
          ordered
          hundreds
          of South Korean journalists fired and banned from newspaper writing or editing. The Basic Press Act of
          December
          1980 was
          the legal capstone of Chun's system of media control and provided for censorship and control of newspapers,
          periodicals,
          and broadcast media. It also set the professional qualifications for journalists.<br><br>Media censorship was
          coordinated with
          intelligence officials, representatives of various government agencies, and the presidential staff by the
          Office
          of Public
          Information Policy within the Ministry of Culture and Information using daily "reporting guidelines" sent to
          newspaper
          editors. The guidelines dealt exhaustively with questions of emphasis, topics to be covered or avoided, the
          use
          of government
          press releases, and even the size of headlines. Enforcement methods ranged from telephone calls to editors to
          more serious
          forms of intimidation, including interrogations and beatings by police. One former Ministry of Culture and
          Information
          official told a National Assembly hearing in 1988 that compliance during his tenure from 1980 to 1982 reached
          about 70
          per cent. By the mid-1980s, censorship of print and broadcast media had become one of the most widely and
          publicly criticised
          practices of the Chun government. Even the government-controlled Yonhap News Agency noted in 1989 that "TV
          companies,
          scarcely worse than other media, were the main target of bitter public criticism for their distorted reporting
          for the
          government in the early 1980s." Editorials called for abolition of the Basic Press Act and related practices,
          a
          bill was
          unsuccessfully introduced in the National Assembly to the same end, and a public campaign to withhold
          compulsory
          viewers'
          fees in protest against censorship by the KBS network received widespread press attention. By the summer of
          1986, even
          the ruling party was responding to public opinion. The political liberalization of the late 1980s brought a
          loosening
          of press restraints and a new generation of journalists more willing to investigate sensitive subjects, such
          as
          the May
          1980 Gwangju massacre. Roh's eight-point declaration of June 29, 1987, provided for "a free press, including
          allowing
          newspapers to base correspondents in provincial cities and withdrawing security officials from newspaper
          offices." The
          South Korean media began a rapid expansion. Seoul papers expanded their coverage and resumed the practice of
          stationing
          correspondents in provincial cities. Although temporarily still under the management of a former Blue House
          press spokesman,
          the MBC television network, a commercial network that had been under control of the state-managed KBS since
          1980, resumed
          independent broadcasting.<br><br>The number of radio broadcast stations grew from 74 in 1985 to 111 (including
          both
          AM
          and FM
          stations) by late 1988 and 125 by late 1989. The number of periodicals rose as the government removed
          restrictions on
          the publishing industry. There also were qualitative changes in the South Korean media. The Christian
          Broadcasting System,
          a radio network, again began to broadcast news as well as religious programming in 1987. In the same year, the
          government
          partially lifted a long-standing ban on the works of North Korean artists and musicians, many of whom were of
          South Korean
          origin. A newspaper run by dissident journalists began publication in 1988. A number of other new dailies also
          appeared
          in 1988. Many of the new weekly and monthly periodicals bypassed the higher profits of the traditional general
          circulation
          magazines to provide careful analyses of political, economic, and national security affairs to smaller,
          specialised audiences.
          Observers noted a dramatic increase in press coverage of previously taboo subjects such as political- military
          relations,
          factions within the military, the role of security agencies in politics, and the activities of dissident
          organisations.
          Opinion polls dealing with these and other sensitive issues also began to appear with increasing regularity.
          Journalists
          at several of the Seoul dailies organised trade unions in late 1987 and early 1988 and began to press for
          editorial autonomy
          and a greater role in newspaper management. In 1989, South Korea's four largest dailies, Hankook Ilbo,
          Joongang
          Ilbo,
          Chosun Ilbo, and Donga Ilbo, had a combined circulation of more than 6.5 million. The anti-establishment The
          Hankyoreh,
          had 450,000 readers – less than the major dailies or smaller papers like Kyonghan Shinmun or Seoul Shinmun,
          but
          larger
          than four more specialised economic dailies. All the major dailies were privately owned, except for the
          government-controlled
          Hankook Ilbo. Several other daily publications had specialised readerships among sport fans and youth. Two
          English-language
          newspapers, the government-subsidised Korea Herald and the Korea Times, which was affiliated with the
          independent Soul
          simmun, were widely read by foreign embassies and businesses. A Chinese-language daily served South Korea's
          small Chinese
          population. The Yonhap News Agency provided domestic and foreign news to government agencies, newspapers, and
          broadcasters.
          Yonhap also provided news on South Korean developments in English by computerised transmission via the
          Asia-Pacific News
          Network.<br><br>Additional links with world media were facilitated by four satellite link stations. The
          International
          Broadcast
          Centre established in June 1988 served some 10,000 broadcasters for the 1988 Seoul Olympics. The government's
          KBS radio
          network broadcast overseas in twelve languages. Two private radio networks, the Asia Broadcasting Company and
          Far East
          Broadcasting Company, served a wide regional audience that included the Soviet Far East, China, and Japan. The
          South Korean
          government also supported Naewoe Press, which dealt solely with North Korean affairs. Originally a propaganda
          vehicle
          that followed the government line on unification policy issues, Naewoe Press became increasingly objective and
          moderate
          in tone in the mid-1980s in interpreting political, social, and economic developments in North Korea. Vantage
          Point, an
          English-language publication of Naewoe Press, provided in-depth studies of North Korean social, economic, and
          political
          developments. Except for two newspapers (one in Korean and one in English) that the government owned or
          controlled and
          the state television network, ownership of the media was for the most part distinct from political or economic
          power.
          One exception was the conservative daily, Joongang Ilbo. Under the close oversight of its owner, the late
          Samsung Group
          founder and multimillionaire Lee Byung-chul, the paper and its affiliated TBC television network generally
          supported the
          Park government during the 1970s. Its relations with the government became strained after 1980, however, when
          Chun Doo
          Hwan forced TBC to merge with KBS. A journalists' strike at Joongang Ilbo in 1989, in one of many similar
          incidents at
          the major South Korean newspapers, won even greater management and editorial independence. Most of South
          Korea's
          major
          newspapers derived their financial support from advertising and from their affiliation with major publishing
          houses.<br><br>The
          Donga Press, for example, published not only the prestigious daily Donga Ilbo, but also a variety of other
          periodicals,
          including a newspaper for children, the general circulation monthly Shin Donga, a women's magazine, and
          specialized reference
          books and magazines for students. Throughout the post-war period, the Donga Ilbo has been noted for its
          opposition sympathies.
          South Korea's principal anti-establishment newspaper, The Hankyoreh, began publication in May 1988. It was
          founded by
          dissident journalists who were purged by the government in the early 1970s or in 1980; many of the paper's
          reporters and
          editorial staff left positions on mainstream newspapers to join the new venture. The structure and approach of
          the paper
          reflected the founders' view that in the past the South Korean news media had been too easily co-opted by the
          government.
          The paper had a human rights department as well as a mass media department to keep an eye on the government's
          press policy
          and to critique the ideological and political biases of other newspapers. The paper's nationalism and interest
          in national
          reunification were symbolically represented in the logo, which depicted Lake Cheonji at the peak of Baekdu
          Mountain in
          North Korea; in the exclusive use of the Korean alphabet; and in the type font in which the paper's name was
          printed,
          which dated from a famous Korean publication of the eighteenth century, before the country became divided. The
          paper was
          printed horizontally, rather than vertically like other Seoul dailies. In other innovations, The Hankyoreh
          relied on sales
          revenues, private contributions, and the sale of stock, rather than advertising from major corporations, in
          line
          with
          its claim to be "the first newspaper in the world truly independent of political power and large capital." The
          newspaper
          came under increasing government pressures in 1989. South Korea also had extensive and well-developed visual
          media. The
          first Korean film was produced in 1919, and cinemas subsequently were built in the larger cities. The result
          of
          the spread
          of television sets and radios was the dissemination of a homogenised popular culture and the impingement of
          urban values
          on rural communities.</p>
        <h3>Current status (1990–today)</h3>
        <p>After decades of state control and heavy censorship, the South Korean press (in print, on television, and
          online) is
          experiencing a period of relative freedom. However, the repressive Basic Press Law was repealed in 1987, and
          since 1990
          the television market has expanded significantly. Whereas in 1980 there were only 28 national newspapers,
          today
          there
          are 122. In 2002, satellite broadcasting brought multi-channel commercial television to homes across South
          Korea. According
          to most outside observers, political discourse is unrestricted in South Korea; however, persistent concerns
          are
          worth
          noting. The National Security Law allows the government to limit the expression of ideas deemed pro-North
          Korean
          or communist;
          broad interpretations of this statute place a chill on peaceful dissent. In addition, in 2003, President Roh
          Moo-Hyun
          brought a libel suit against four of the major national newspapers, and the government has stated that
          editorials are
          subject to legal action if they are found to contain falsehoods. Outside observers have criticised pressure
          tactics used
          by both the South Korean government and the business community to influence reporting. Major newspapers
          include
          Chosun
          Ilbo, Donga Ilbo, Joongang Ilbo, and Hankook Ilbo, all published in Seoul. The five nationwide television
          networks are
          KBS-1 and KBS-2 (public broadcast), MBC (run as a public organization), EBS (state-funded), and SBS (a
          commercial broadcaster).
          Some 70 percent of South Korean households have broadband Internet access, and the online media marketplace is
          growing
          rapidly. Popular news Web sites (such as OhMyNews.com) register as many as 15 million visits per day. Today,
          much of the
          news in South Korea is delivered through electronic means and the country is at the leading edge of the
          digital
          revolution
          and a trailblazer for high-speed and wireless internet services.</p>

        <h2>Print media</h2>
        <h3>Books</h3>
        <p>Baegunhwasang Chorokbuljo Jikjisimcheyojeol (Jikji, Anthology Teachings of Zen Buddhist Priests) is the
          world's
          oldest
          extant movable metal print book. It was published in 1377 (Goryeo Dynasty), 78 years prior to Johannes
          Gutenberg's "42-Line
          Bible" printed during the years 1452-1455. In 1446, 'Hunminjeongeum' was published by Sejong, fourth king of
          'Joseon Dynasty'
          and scholars of 'Jiphyunjeon'. This text describes the promulgation of 'Hangul', which is the basis for the
          modern native
          Korean alphabet. It is constructed in two parts: 'Hunminjeongeum Yeibon'(the body) and 'Hunminjeongeum
          Haerebon'(explanations).
          In the introduction King Sejong revealed that the purpose of creating the Hunminjeongeum. In 1997, it was
          inscribed into
          the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.</p>
        <h3>Newspaper</h3>
        <p>Published in Late-Chosun, Hansung Sunbo was the first modern newspaper in Korea. It was published in
          Bakmunkuk
          which
          was an official printing office. It was written in Hanja and published every 10 days. Hansung Sunbo carried
          both
          domestic
          and foreign news and it had enlightened opinions. The Independent was the first newspaper written in Korean,
          and
          the first
          private newspaper. Seo Jae-Pil published it in two version: Korean Hangul and English. The Independent made an
          effort
          to enlighten people and denounce absurd Chosun officers. After the 1980s, newspapers received greater freedom,
          after the
          Basic Press Law was repealed. Nowadays, Chosun Ilbo, Dong-A Ilbo, and Jung-Ang Ilbo are the major newspapers
          with conservative
          views; Hankook Ilbo is moderate; Kyunghyang Shinmun and The Hankyoreh are the major newspapers with liberal
          views. In
          South Korea, conservative newspapers are more widely read. Maeil Business Newspaper and Korea Economic Daily
          are
          the major
          business newspapers. In South Korea, as in many other countries, newspaper subscribers are decreasing.</p>

        <h2>Electronic media</h2>
        <h3>Radio</h3>
        <p>The first radio broadcasting was JODK by 'Kyungsung Broadcasting' in 1927. Some people regard HLKA by 'Korean
          Broadcasting
          system' in 1947 as the first radio broadcasting in Korea. Since 2003, DAB(Digital Audio Broadcasting) or
          DAR(Digital Audio
          Radio) services have been used.
        </p>
        <h4>Radio Channels</h4>
        <p>As standard radio stations, there are KBS, MBC, SBS, EBS.
        <ul>
          <li>KBS, public broadcasting group operates 7 channels. KBS Radio 1, KBS Radio 2, KBS Radio 3, KBS 1FM,
            KBS

            KBS Hanminjeok Radio and KBS World Radio.</li>
          <li>MBC</li>
        </ul>
        In Korea, MBC Radio is the most popular in general because there are several long-running programs. MBC operates
        2
        channels:
        FM4U and Standard FM. 'Cho Yeong-Nam & Choi Yu-ra's Radio Golden Age' is the most famous program which provides
        funny
        stories and K-pop music.
        <ul>
          <li>SBS</li>
        </ul>
        SBS also operates two channels in radio: Power FM and Love AM.
        <ul>
          <li>EBS(Educational Broadcasting System)</li>
          <li>CBS: is the first commercial radio broadcaster in South Korea. It contains programs about Christianity.
          </li>
          <li>Other religious programming broadcasters: PBC(Pyeonghwa Broadcasting Corporation, 평화방송), BBS(Buddhism
            Broadcasting

          <li>Traffic broadcasters: TBS(Traffic Broadcasting System). They specialize in traffic. Many other stations
            also
            provide
            hourly traffic condition reports, typically for 3 minutes every 57 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        There are many radio stations in Korea, but channels are not uniquely distinctive. KBS 1FM, KBS 1AM, TBS
        (Traffic
        Broadcasting
        System) are somewhat distinctive. Other channels are usually broadcast according to people's lifestyle.</p>
        <h3>Television</h3>
        <p>KORCAD was the first TV station in South Korea, which launched in 1956. In South Korea, terrestrial
          television
          broadcasting
          is common and popular. As terrestrial broadcasters, there are five channels with four television stations:
        <ul>
          <li>KBS 1TV</li>
          <li>KBS 2TV</li>
          <li>MBC</li>
          <li>EBS</li>
          <li>SBS</li>
        </ul>
        KBS, MBC, EBS are public broadcasters while SBS is a commercial broadcaster, under a "many public broadcasters"
        system. It
        is a unique system; other countries typically have one public broadcaster and many commercial broadcasters. KBS
        is
        funded
        by public money accrued from a television license fee gathered from all South Korea households with a television
        set.
        As of 2010, the fee is ₩2500 (about $2 USD). Due to low public funds, KBS2 runs commercials. Looking at the
        ownership
        of MBC, 70% of it is owned by a government-owned not-for-profit organization (The Foundation of Broadcast
        Culture), and
        30% of it belongs to 'Jeong-su Scholarship Foundation'. Also, because KBS2 and MBC run commercials, there are a
        lot of
        controversies on the definition of public broadcasting in South Korea. Digital television technology emerged
        recently.
        Although some television stations have begun broadcasting digital signals, it is not yet widespread as in the
        United States.
        The Government of South Korea set December 31, 2012 as the deadline for digital conversion in South Korea. From
        2013,
        South Korea will convert from the analogue broadcasting to the digital broadcasting.(This date coincides with
        the
        United
        Kingdom conversion date.) According to DTV Korea, the rate of digital TV sets in use is about 60% (2010).</p>

        <h2>New media</h2>
        <h3>Internet</h3>
        <p>When it comes to Internet use, South Korea ranked third in the world in 2003. According to statistics of the
          Korean
          Ministry of Information and Communication, 78.5% of families own a computer, of which 93.6% use the Internet
          (2005). Many
          businesses utilize the Internet in Korea for services such as news, social media, shopping, banking, games,
          and
          educational
          content.</p>
        <h3>Internet journalism</h3>
        <p>Joongang Ilbo developed the first internet news website in Asia in 1995. After the start, almost every daily
          newspaper
          made its website. There are also online-only portals like Pressian.</p>
        <h3>Social media</h3>
        <p>As in other countries, social media has come into the spotlight in South Korea. The most well notable Social
          Medias

          broadcasters, and freedom of expression each.</p>
        <h3>Business regulations</h3>
        <h4>Restriction market entry</h4>
        <p>It is the most powerful regulation that decide who will broadcasting business. The grounds of this regulation
          are largely that: electromagnetic wave is scarce, so all of those who want to operate a broadcasting system
          cannot do it, and the providers have to set fair to operate a broadcaster (ex, financial power, social
          experiences etc.) Until just recently large companies (above top 30), newspaper, agency couldn't operate a
          broadcasting system because of the independence of media. (It caused problems in Korea in history.) But

          newly revised media law allows it.
        <ul>
          <li>Terrestrial broadcasting, Cable Television broadcasting, satellite broadcasting: government permit</li>
          <li>News channel, General service channel, home-shopping channel: government's approval</li>

          It is the most powerful regulation that decide who will broadcasting business. The grounds of this regulation
          are largely that: electromagnetic wave is scarce, so all of those who want to operate a broadcasting system

        <h4>Ownership restrictions</h4>
        <p>It means restriction on the number of broadcasting system that one provider can own. Its purpose is to
          prevent
          monopoly or oligopoly on broadcasting. In Summary:

          <li>One provider (person or corporation) can only own one business on the Terrestrial broadcaster and
            satellite
            broadcaster.</li>
          <li>Cable system operator and program provider can own more than one broadcaster and transmission line. But,
            they can be restricted by the government with regards to market share and the number of providers.</li>
          <li>One provider can own terrestrial broadcaster, satellite broadcaster, and cable broadcaster except a
            combination of terrestrial broadcaster and cable broadcaster.</li>
          <li>On cable broadcasting, one provider can serve system operator, network operator, and program provider but,
            they can restricted with regard to a market share and the number of providers.</li>
