        <h2>Korean Culture</h2>
        <p>The traditional culture of Korea is the shared cultural and historical heritage of Korea before the division
          of Korea in 1945. Since the mid-20th century, Korea has been split between the North Korean and South Korean
          states, resulting in a number of cultural differences that can be observed even today. Before the Joseon
          dynasty, the practice of Korean shamanism was deeply rooted in Korean culture.</p>

        <h2>Clothing</h2>
        <p>The traditional dress known as hanbok (한복, 韓服) (known as joseonot [조선옷] in the DPRK) has been worn since
          ancient times. The hanbok consists of a shirt (jeogori) and a skirt (chima). According to social status,
          Koreans used to dress differently, making clothing an important mark of social rank. Costumes were worn by the
          ruling class and the royal family. These upper classes also used jewelry to distance themselves from the
          ordinary people. A traditional item of jewellery for women was a pendant in the shape of certain elements of
          nature which was made of gemstones, to which a tassel of silk was connected. Common people were often
          restricted to undyed plain clothes. This everyday dress underwent relatively few changes during the Joseon
          period. The basic everyday dress was shared by everyone, but distinctions were drawn in official and
          ceremonial clothes. During the winter people wore cotton-wadded dresses. Fur was also common. Because ordinary
          people normally wore pure white undyed materials, the people were sometimes referred to as the white-clad
          people. Hanbok are classified according to their purposes: everyday dress, ceremonial dress and special dress.
          Ceremonial dresses are worn on formal occasions, including a child's first birthday (doljanchi), a wedding or
          a funeral. Special dresses are made for purposes such as shamans, officials. Today the hanbok is still worn
          during formal occasions. The everyday use of the dress, however, has been lost. However, the elderly still
          dress in hanbok as well as active estates of the remnant of aristocratic families from the Joseon Dynasty.
          Though this may be changing with something of a modern interest in the traditional dress among some of the
          young. Traditionally, the hanbok was a wedding dress that dates back to the 14th century. It was a
          floor-length gown with an empire waist, fitted jacket, and sewn with vibrant or pastel colors. The use of the
          Hanbok in daily wear has dropped significantly over the last handful of decades. Park Hyung Sook has
          challenged the traditional hanbok that Korea is used to. Park Hyung Sook has been designing for decades before
          she ventured out on her own. She is known to wear her own designs paired with jeans or shorts for a more
          casual look. Her clothes are meant to be worn either casually or formally, it is not fast fashion but easy.
          For one of her collections, she focused on black and white pieces that can be worn to brunch, the office, or
          even formal events. It is a drastic difference from the rainbow colors that used to be worn by Korea's royalty
          and upper-class citizens of the Joseon Dynasty, where the colors of your hanbok spoke of your status. Some of
          Park's designs consisted of mini skirts with ruffles, spaghetti straps, polka dots, and other vivid designs.
          Park Hyung Sook and her sister Geum Sook, launched their first collection titled GrangHanA in 2014. Just like
          most things, when it comes to changing something that has not changed in many decades, there is always
          pushback. When Park was asked about opening a shop outside of Korea, she was touched. Although many critics of
          the hanbok told her that the design should be left alone, she countered them. Hanbok is a garment that is
          beautiful in its own way, and many have tried to keep it from changing. Many have questioned the logic behind
          keeping hanbok where it is, within Korea, and not letting it venture out. Many designers have tried to take
          Hanbok overseas. The Korean In Me, a designer brand, also released a collection of modern hanbok that has been
          embraced by people all over the world. Their designs feature embroidered dragons and phoenix patterns
          originally reserved for royalty, and peonies embroidered on wedding dresses representing honor and wealth.
          Giving the hanbok a meaningful design that links them to the culture and heritage of Korea. In recent years,
          with the rise of attention to K-Pop, (Korean Pop Music), interest in Korean culture has spiked to an all-time
          high. Many groups, such as BTS, BlackPink, KARD, and many more, have been praised for showing their culture
          and heritage by wearing Hanbok in music videos, award shows, and other public appearances.</p>

        <h2>Festivals</h2>
        <p>The traditional Korean calendar was based on the lunisolar calendar. Dates are calculated from Korea's
          meridian. Observances and festivals are rooted in Korean culture. The Korean lunar calendar is divided into 24
          turning points (절기, jeolgi), each lasting about 15 days. The lunar calendar was the timetable for the agrarian
          society in the past, but is vanishing in the modern Korean lifestyle. The Gregorian calendar was officially
          adopted in 1895, but traditional holidays and age reckoning are still based on the old calendar. Older
          generations still celebrate their birthdays according to the lunar calendar. The biggest festival in Korea
          today is Seollal (the traditional Korean New Year). Other important festivals include Daeboreum (the first
          full moon), Dano (spring festival), and Chuseok (harvest festival). There are also a number of regional
          festivals, celebrated according to the lunar calendar.</p>

        <h2>Fine arts</h2>
        <h3>Ceramics</h3>
        <p>In the Goryeo period, jade green celadon ware became more popular. In the 12th century, sophisticated methods
          of inlaying were invented, allowing more elaborate decorations in different colors. In Arts of Korea, Evelyn
          McCune states, "During the twelfth century, the production of ceramic ware reached its highest refinement.
          Several new varieties appeared simultaneously in the quarter of a century, one of which, the inlaid ware must
          be considered a Korean invention." William Bowyer Honey of the Victoria and Albert Museum of England after
          World War II wrote, "The best Corean (Korean) wares were not only original, they are the most gracious and
          unaffected pottery ever made. They have every virtue that pottery can have. This Korean pottery, in fact,
          reached heights hardly attained even by the Chinese." White porcelain became popular in the 15th century and
          soon overtook celadon ware. White porcelain was commonly painted or decorated with copper. During the Imjin
          wars in the 16th century, Korean potters were brought back to Japan where they heavily influenced Japanese
          ceramics. Many Japanese pottery families today can trace their art and ancestry to these Korean potters whom
          the Japanese captured during its attempted conquests of the Korean peninsula. In the late Joseon period (late
          17th century) blue-and-white porcelain became popular. Designs were painted in cobalt blue on white porcelain.

        <h3>Crafts</h3>
        <p>There is a unique set of handicrafts produced in Korea. Most of the handicrafts are created for particular
          everyday use, often giving priority to practical use rather than aesthetics.[citation needed] Traditionally,
          metal, wood, fabric, lacquerware, and earthenware were the main materials used, but later glass, leather or
          paper have sporadically been used. Many sophisticated and elaborate handicrafts have been excavated, including
          gilt crowns, patterned pottery, pots or ornaments. During the Goryeo period the use of bronze was advanced.
          Brass, that is copper with one third zinc, has been a particularly popular material. The dynasty, however, is
          most prominently renowned for its use of celadon ware. During the Joseon period, popular handicrafts were made
          of porcelain and decorated with blue painting. Woodcraft was also advanced during that period. This led to
          more sophisticated pieces of furniture, including wardrobes, chests, tables or drawers. It is part of a craft
          that goes back well over a millennium, keeping alive a tradition that remains unchanged from at least the
          seventeenth century. It is this tradition that has made Korean furniture one of the most sought-after styles
          of exotic furniture by antique dealers and collectors worldwide. Immediately recognizable as Korean, this
          unique art was only "discovered" by the West in the late 1940s and 1950s.</p>

        <h3>Dance and martial arts</h3>
        <p>In Korea, there is a distinction between court dance and folk dance. Common court dances are jeongjaemu (정재무)
          performed at banquets, and ilmu (일무), performed at Korean Confucian rituals. Jeongjaemu is divided into native
          dances (향악정재, hyangak jeongjae) and forms imported from Central Asia and China (당악정재, dangak jeongjae). Ilmu
          are divided into civil dance (문무, munmu) and military dance (무무, mumu). Many mask dramas and mask dances are
          performed in many regional areas of Korea. The traditional clothing is the genja, it is a special kind of
          dress that women wear on festivals. It is pink with multiple symbols around the neck area. Traditional
          choreography of court dances is reflected in many contemporary productions, and the strong dance tradition in
          the country carries on to this day, with many dance groups forming over the last few decades. Taekkyon, a
          traditional Korean martial art, is central to the classic Korean dance. Taekkyon, being a complete system of
          integrated movement, found its core techniques adaptable to mask, dance and other traditional artforms of
          Korea. Taekwondo, a Korean martial art, began in the 1940s in Korea.</p>

        <h3>Painting</h3>
        <p>The earliest paintings found on the Korean peninsula are petroglyphs of prehistoric times. With the arrival
          of Buddhism from India via China, different techniques were introduced.[citation needed] These techniques
          quickly established themselves as the mainstream techniques, but indigenous techniques still survived. Among
          them were the Goguryeo tomb murals. These murals inside many of the tombs are an invaluable insight into the
          ceremonies, warfare, architecture, and daily life of ancient Goguryeo people.[citation needed] Balhae kingdom,
          a successor state of Goguryeo, absorbed much of traditional Goguryeo elements. There is a tendency towards
          naturalism with subjects such as realistic landscapes, flowers and birds being particularly popular. Ink is
          the most common material used, and it is painted on mulberry paper or silk. Humorous details are sometimes
          present. In the 18th century, indigenous techniques were advanced, particularly in calligraphy and seal
          engraving. During the Joseon period, new genres of Korean painting flourished, such as chaekgeori (paintings
          of books) and munjado (paintings of letters), revealing the infatuation with books and learning in Korean
          culture. Arts are both influenced by tradition and realism. For example, Han's near-photographic "Break Time
          at the Ironworks" shows muscular men dripping with sweat and drinking water from tin cups at a sweltering
          foundry.[citation needed] Jeong Son’s "Peak Chonnyo of Mount Kumgang" is a classical Korean landscape of
          towering cliffs shrouded by mists.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>There is a genre distinction between folk music and court music. Korean folk music is varied and complex in
          different ways, but all forms of folk music maintain a set of rhythms (called 장단; Jangdan) and a loosely
          defined set of melodic modes. Korean folk music is Pansori (판소리) performed by one singer and one drummer.
          Occasionally, there might be dancers and narrators. They have been designated an intangible cultural property
          in UNESCO's Memory of the world, and Pungmul (풍물) performed by drumming, dancing and singing. Samul Nori is a
          type of Korean traditional music based on Pungmul, and Sanjo (산조) that is played without a pause in faster
          tempos. Nongak (농악) means "farmers' music". Korean court music can be traced to the beginning of the Joseon
          Dynasty in 1392. Korean court musics include A-ak, Dang-ak and Hyang-ak. The traditional Korean music is still
          played and sung a lot.</p>

        <h2>Gardens</h2>
        <p>The principles of temple gardens and private gardens are the same. Korean gardening in East Asia is
          influenced by primarily Korean Shamanism and Korean folk religion. The lotus pond is an important feature in
          the Korean garden. If there is a natural stream, often a pavilion is built next to it, allowing the pleasure
          of watching the water. Terraced flower beds are a common feature in traditional Korean gardens. The
          Poseokjeong site near Gyeongju was built in the Silla period. It highlights the importance of water in
          traditional Korean gardens. The garden of Poseokjeong features an abalone-shaped watercourse. During the last
          days of the Silla kingdom, the king's guests would sit along the watercourse and chat while wine cups were
          floated during banquets.</p>

        <h2>Houses</h2>
        <p>Korean traditional houses are called Hanok (Hangul:한옥). Sites of residence are traditionally selected using
          traditional geomancy. While the geomancy had been a vital part of Korean culture and Korean Shamanism since
          prehistoric times, geomancy was later re-introduced by China during the Three Kingdoms period of Korea's
          history. A house is built against a hill and face south to receive as much sunlight as possible.[citation
          needed] This orientation is still preferred in modern Korea. Geomancy also influences the shape of the
          building, the direction it faces, and the material the house is constructed with. Traditional Korean houses
          can be structured into an inner wing (안채, anchae) and an outer wing (사랑채, sarangchae). The individual layout
          largely depends on the region and the wealth of the family. Whereas aristocrats used the outer wing for
          receptions, poorer people kept cattle in the sarangchae. The wealthier a family, the larger the house.
          However, it was forbidden to any family except for the king to have a residence of more than 99 kan.[citation
          needed] A kan is the distance between two pillars used in traditional houses. The inner wing normally
          consisted of a living room, a kitchen, and a wooden-floored central hall. More rooms may be attached to this.
          Poorer farmers would not have any outer wings. Floor heating (온돌, ondol) has been used in Korea since
          prehistoric times. The main building materials are wood, clay, tile, stone, and thatch. Because wood and clay
          were the most common materials used in the past not many old buildings have survived into present times.</p>

        <h2>Religious beliefs</h2>
        <p>The original religion of the Korean people was Shamanism, which though not as widespread as in ancient times,
          still survives to this day. Female shamans or mudang are often called upon to enlist the help of various
          spirits to achieve various means. Buddhism and Confucianism were later introduced to Korea through cultural
          exchanges with Chinese dynasties. Buddhism was the official religion of the Goryeo dynasty, and many
          privileges were given to Buddhist monks during this period. However, the Joseon period saw the suppression of
          Buddhism, where Buddhist monks and temples were banned from the cities and confined to the countryside. In its
          place a strict form of Confucianism, which some see as even more strict than what had ever been adopted by the
          Chinese, became the official philosophy. Korean Confucianism was epitomized by the seonbi class, scholars who
          passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity. Throughout Korean history and
          culture, regardless of separation, the traditional beliefs of Korean Shamanism, Mahayana Buddhism and
          Confucianism have remained an underlying influence of the religion of the Korean people as well as a vital
          aspect of their culture. In fact, all these traditions coexisted peacefully for hundreds of years. They still
          exist in the more Christian South and in the North, despite pressure from its government.</p>

        <h3>Influence of Buddhism on culture and traditions</h3>
        <p>Korean culture is deeply influenced by the Buddhism as Buddhism has become inherent aspect of the Korea
          culture, including the secular Korean traditions followed by the non-Buddhist Koreans. A 2005 government
          survey indicated that about a quarter of South Koreans identified as Buddhist. However, the actual number of
          Buddhists in South Korea is ambiguous as there is no exact or exclusive criterion by which Buddhists can be
          identified, unlike the Christian population. With Buddhism's incorporation into traditional Korean culture, it
          is now considered a philosophy and cultural background rather than a formal religion. As a result, many people
          outside of the practicing population are deeply influenced by these traditions. Thus, when counting secular
          believers or those influenced by the faith while not following other religions, the number of Buddhists in
          South Korea is considered to be much larger. Similarly, in officially atheist North Korea, while Buddhists
          officially account for 4.5% of the population, a much larger number (over 70%) of the population are
          influenced by Buddhist philosophies and customs. When Buddhism was originally introduced to Korea from Former
          Qin [the 4th century state in Northern China] in 372, about 800 years after the death of the historical
          Gautama Buddha [founder of Buddhism], shamanism [a religious practice] was the indigenous religion. The Samguk
          yusa and Samguk sagi record the following 3 monks who were among the first to bring Buddhist teaching, or
          Dharma, to Korea in the 4th century during the Three Kingdoms period: Malananta – an Indian Buddhist monk who
          came from Serindian area of southern China's Eastern Jin Dynasty and brought Buddhism to the King Baekje of
          Baekje in the southern Korean peninsula in 384 CE, Sundo – a monk from northern Chinese state Former Qin
          brought Buddhism to Goguryeo in northern Korea in 372 CE, and Ado – a monk who brought Buddhism to Silla in
          central Korea. As Buddhism was not seen to conflict with the rites of nature worship, it was allowed by
          adherents of Shamanism to be blended into their religion. Thus, the mountains that were believed by shamanists
          to be the residence of spirits in pre-Buddhist times later became the sites of Buddhist temples. Though it
          initially enjoyed wide acceptance, even being supported as the state ideology during the Goryeo (918–1392 CE)
          period, Buddhism in Korea suffered extreme repression during the Joseon (1392–1897 CE) era, which lasted over
          five hundred years. During this period, Neo-Confucianism overcame the prior dominance of Buddhism. Only after
          Buddhist monks helped repel the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98) did the persecution of Buddhists stop.
          Buddhism in Korea remained subdued until the end of the Joseon period when its position was strengthened
          somewhat by the colonial period, which lasted from 1910 to 1945. However, these Buddhist monks did not only
          put an end to Japanese rule in 1945, but they also asserted their specific and separate religious identity by
          reforming their traditions and practices. They laid the foundation for many Buddhist societies, and the
          younger generation of monks came up with the ideology of Mingung Pulgyo, or "Buddhism for the people." The
          importance of this ideology is that it was coined by the monks who focused on common men's daily issues.</p>

        <h2>Modern cultures</h2>
        <h3>Culture of Korea</h3>
        <p>The contemporary culture of South Korea developed from the traditional culture of Korea which was prevalent
          in the early Korean nomadic tribes. By maintaining thousands of years of ancient Korean culture, South Korea
          has split on its own path of cultural development away from North Korean culture since the division of Korea
          in 1949. The industrialization [the development of industries in a country or region on a wide scale],
          urbanization [process of population movement to cities] and westernization [the adoption of or assimilation by
          the Western culture] of South Korea, especially Seoul [the capital of South Korea], have brought many changes
          to the way Korean people live. Changing economics and lifestyles have led to a concentration of population in
          major cities and depopulation of the rural countryside, with multi-generational [root word: generation]
          households separating into nuclear family [a group of two parents and their people] living expensives. Today,
          many Korean cultural elements, especially popular culture, have spread across the globe and have become some
          of the most prominent cultural forces in the world.</p>

        <h3>Culture of North Korea</h3>
        <p>In North Korea, a central theme of cultural expression is to take the best from the past and discard
          capitalist elements. Popular, vernacular styles and themes in the arts such as literature, art, music and
          dance are esteemed as expressing the truly unique spirit of the Korean nation. Ethnographers, [i.e. people who
          do qualitative research that involves immersing yourself in a particular community or organisation to observe
          their behavior and interactions up close], devote much energy to restoring and reintroducing cultural forms
          that have the proper proletarian, or folk, spirit and that encourage the development of collective
          consciousness. Proletarian refers to the Marxism study of the classes in terms of Capitalism [not to be
          confused with the caste system, developed by the Aryans], including the Proletarians and Bourgeoisie. Other
          classes including landlords, petty bourgeoisie, peasants, and lumpenproletariat also exist but are not primary
          in terms of the dynamics of capitalism. Last but not least, lively, optimistic musical and choreographic
          expressions are stressed when it comes to dance. Group folk dances and choral singing are traditionally
          practiced in some but not all parts of Korea. They were being promoted throughout North Korea in the early
          1990s among schools and university students. Farmers' music bands have also been revived.</p>

          contains over 10,000 exhibits, including 11 first-level artifacts. The exhibits' labels and explanations are

        <p>The Jongmyo Shrine was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1995 and is located in Seoul. The
          shrine is dedicated to the spirits of the ancestors of the royal family of the Joseon Dynasty. It is heavily
          influenced by Korean Confucian tradition. An elaborate performance of ancient court music (with accompanying
          dance) known as Jongmyo jeryeak is performed there each year. When it was built in 1394 it was to be one of
          the longest buildings in Asia. There are 19 memorial tablets of kings and 30 of their queens, placed in 19
          chambers. The shrine was burnt to the ground during the Imjin wars, but rebuilt in 1608.</p>

        <h3>Changdeokgung</h3>
        <p>Changdeokgung is also known as the "palace of illustrious virtue". It was built in 1405, burnt to the ground
          during the Imjin wars in 1592 and reconstructed in 1609. For more than 300 years Changdeokgung was the site of

        <h3>Tripitaka Koreana and Haeinsa</h3>
        <p>Haeinsa is a large temple in the South Gyeongsang province. It was originally built in 802 and home to the
          Tripitaka Koreana wood blocks, the oldest Buddhist wooden manuscripts in the world. The carving of these wood
          blocks was initiated in 1236 and completed in 1251. The wood blocks are testimony to the pious devotion of
          king and his people. The word Tripitaka is Sanskrit and stands for three baskets, referring to the Buddhist
          laws of aesthetics. The Tripitaka Koreana consists of 81'258 wood blocks and is the largest, oldest, and most
          complete collection of Buddhist scripts. Amazingly there is no trace of errata or omission on any of the wood
          blocks. The Tripitaka Koreana is widely considered as the most beautiful and accurate Buddhist canon carved in
          Hanja. The site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1995.</p>

        <h3>Sansa, Buddhist Mountain Monasteries</h3>
        <p>The Sansa are Buddhist mountain monasteries located throughout the southern provinces of the Korean
          Peninsula. The spatial arrangement of the seven temples that comprise the property, established from the 7th
          to 9th centuries, present common characteristics that are specific to Korea – the ‘madang’ (open courtyard)
          flanked by four buildings (Buddha Hall, pavilion, lecture hall and dormitory). They contain a large number of
          individually remarkable structures, objects, documents and shrines. These mountain monasteries are sacred
          places, which have survived as living centres of faith and daily religious practice to the present.</p>

            <h3>Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa sites</h3>
            <p>The sites of Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa were added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage in 2000. These
              sites are home to prehistoric graveyards which contain hundreds of different megaliths. These megaliths
              are gravestones which were created in the 1st century B.C. out of large blocks of rock. Megaliths can be
              found around the globe, but nowhere in such a concentration as in the sites of Gochang, Hwasun and
              Ganghwa.</p>

            <h3>Gyeongju Area</h3>
            <p>The historic area around Gyeongju was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage in 2000. Gyeongju was
              the capital of the Silla kingdom. The tombs of the Silla rulers can still be found in the centre of the
              city. These tombs took the shape of rock chambers buried in an earthen hill, sometimes likened with the
              pyramids. The area around Gyeongju, in particular on the Namsan mountain, is scattered with hundreds of
              remains from the Silla period. Poseokjeong is one of the most famous of these sites, but there is a great
              number of Korean Buddhist art, sculptures, reliefs, pagodas and remains of temples and palaces mostly
              built in the 7th and 10th century.</p>

            <p>The Complex of Koguryo Tombs lies in Pyongyang, Pyong'an South Province, and Nampo City, South Hwanghae
              Province, North Korea. In July 2004 it became the first UNESCO World Heritage site north of the 38th

              Korea. It was founded around northern Korea and Manchuria around 32 BC, and the capital was moved to
              Pyongyang in 427. This kingdom dominated the region between the 5th and 7th century AD.</p>
