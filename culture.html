      <h3>Culture and Arts</h3>
      <p>In ancient Chinese texts, Korea is referred to as "Rivers and Mountains Embroidered on Silk" and "Eastern
        Nation of
        Decorum". Individuals are regarded as one year old when they are born, as Koreans reckon the pregnancy period as
        one year
        of life for infants, and age increments increase on New Year's Day rather than on the anniversary of birthdays.
        Thus,
        one born immediately before New Year's Day may only be a few days old in western reckoning, but two years old in
        Korea.
        Accordingly, a Korean person's stated age (at least among fellow Koreans) will be one or two years more than
        their age
        according to western reckoning. However, western reckoning is sometimes applied with regard to the concept of
        legal age;
        for example, the legal age for purchasing alcohol or cigarettes in the Republic of Korea is 19, which is
        measured according
        to western reckoning.</p>

      <h3>Literature</h3>
      <p>Korean literature written before the end of the Joseon Dynasty is called "Classical" or "Traditional."
        Literature, written
        in Chinese characters (hanja), was established at the same time as the Chinese script arrived on the peninsula.
        Korean
        scholars were writing poetry in the classical Korean style as early as the 2nd centuryâ€‰BCE, reflecting Korean
        thoughts
        and experiences of that time. Classical Korean literature has its roots in traditional folk beliefs and folk
        tales of
        the peninsula, strongly influenced by Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism.
        <br><br>
        Modern literature is often linked with the development of hangul, which helped spread literacy from the
        aristocracy to the common people. Hangul, however, only reached a dominant position in Korean literature in the
        second half of the 19th century, resulting in a major growth in Korean literature. Sinsoseol, for instance, are
        novels written in hangul.
        <br><br>
        The Korean War led to the development of literature centered on the wounds and chaos of war. Much of the
        post-war literature in South Korea deals with the daily lives of ordinary people, and their struggles with
        national pain. The collapse of the traditional Korean value system is another common theme of the time.

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>Traditional Korean music includes combinations of the folk, vocal, religious and ritual music styles of the
        Korean people. Korean music has been practiced since prehistoric times. Korean music falls into two broad
        categories. The first, Hyangak, literally means The local music or Music native to Korea, a famous example of
        which is Sujechon, a piece of instrumental music often claimed to be at least 1,300 years old. The second,
        yangak, represents a more Western style.</p>

      <h3>Religion</h3>
      <p>Confucian tradition has dominated Korean thought, along with contributions by Buddhism, Taoism, and Korean
        Shamanism. Since the middle of the 20th century, however, Christianity has competed with Buddhism in South
        Korea, while religious practice has been suppressed in North Korea. Throughout Korean history and culture,
        regardless of separation; the influence of traditional beliefs of Korean Shamanism, Mahayana Buddhism,
        Confucianism and Taoism have remained an underlying religion of the Korean people as well as a vital aspect of
        their culture; all these traditions have coexisted peacefully for hundreds of years up to today despite strong
        Westernisation from Christian missionary conversions in the South or the pressure from the Juche government in
        the North.
        <br><br>
        According to 2005 statistics compiled by the South Korean government, about 46% of citizens profess to follow no
        particular religion. Christians account for 29.2% of the population (of which are Protestants 18.3% and
        Catholics 10.9%) and Buddhists 22.8%.
        <br><br>
        Islam in South Korea is practiced by about 45,000 natives (about 0.09% of the population) in addition to some
        100,000 foreign workers from Muslim countries.
