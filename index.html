      <h3>Korea Today</h3>
      <p>Korea, or the Korean Peninsula, is a region in East Asia. Since 1945 it has been divided into the two parts
        which soon became the two sovereign states: North Korea (officially the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea")
        and South Korea officially the "Republic of Korea"). Korea consists of the Korean Peninsula, Jeju Island, and
        several minor islands near the peninsula. It is bordered by China to the northwest and Russia to the northeast.
        It is separated from Japan to the east by the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea).</p>

      <h3>A Brief Korean History</h3>
      <p>During the first half of the 1st millennium, Korea was divided between the three competing states of Goguryeo,
        Baekje, and Silla, together known as the Three Kingdoms of Korea. In the second half of the 1st millennium,
        Silla defeated and conquered Baekje and Goguryeo, leading to the "Unified Silla" period. Meanwhile, Balhae
        formed in the north, superseding former Goguryeo. Unified Silla eventually collapsed into three separate states
        due to civil war, ushering in the Three Kingdoms. Toward the end of the 1st millennium, Goguryeo was resurrected
        as Goryeo, which defeated the two other states and unified the Korean Peninsula as a single sovereign state.
        Around the same time, Balhae collapsed and its last crown prince fled south to Goryeo. Goryeo (also spelled as
        Kory≈è), whose name developed into the modern exonym "Korea", was a highly cultured state that created the
        world's first metal moveable type in 1234. However, multiple incursions by the Mongol Empire during the 13th
        century greatly weakened the nation, which eventually agreed to become a vassal state after decades of fighting.
        Following military resistance under King Gongmin that ended Mongol political influence in Goryeo, severe
        political strife followed, and Goryeo eventually fell to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye, who established
        Joseon on 17 July 1392.
        <br><br>
        The first 200 years of the Joseon era were marked by relative peace. During this period, the Korean alphabet was
        created by Sejong the Great in the 15th century and there was increasing influence of Confucianism. During the
        later part of the dynasty, Korea's isolationist policy earned it the Western nickname of the "Hermit Kingdom".
        By the late 19th century, the country became the object of imperial design by the Empire of Japan. After the
        First Sino-Japanese War, despite the Korean Empire's effort to modernize, the country became a protectorate of
        Japan in 1905 then was annexed by Japan outright on 22 August 1910 and directly ruled by it until the end of
        World War II on 2 September 1945. In 1945, the Soviet Union and the United States agreed on the surrender of
        Japanese forces in Korea in the aftermath of World War II, leaving Korea partitioned along the 38th parallel.
        The North was under Soviet occupation and the South under American occupation. These circumstances became the
        basis for the division of Korea by the two superpowers with two different ideologies, exacerbated by their
        inability to agree on the terms of Korean independence. The Communist-inspired government in the North received
        backing from the Soviet Union in opposition to the pro-Western government in the South, leading to Korea's
        division into two political entities in 1948: North Korea, and South Korea. Tensions between the two resulted in
        the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950. With involvement by foreign troops, the war ended in a stalemate in
        1953, but without a formalized peace treaty. This status contributes to the high tensions that continue to
        divide the peninsula. Both governments of the two Koreas continue to claim to be the sole legitimate government
        of the region.
