      <h3>Korean Cuisine</h3>
      <p>Koreans traditionally believe that the taste and quality of food depend on its spices and sauces, the essential
        ingredients
        to making a delicious meal. Therefore, soybean paste, soy sauce, gochujang or red pepper paste and kimchi are
        some of
        the most important staples in a Korean household.
        <br><br>
        Korean cuisine was greatly influenced by the geography and climate of the Korean Peninsula, which is known for
        its cold autumns and winters, therefore there are many fermented dishes and hot soups and stews.
        <br><br>
        Korean cuisine is probably best known for kimchi, a side dish which uses a distinctive fermentation process of
        preserving vegetables, most commonly cabbage. Kimchi is said to relieve the pores on the skin, thereby reducing
        wrinkles and providing nutrients to the skin naturally. It is also healthy, as it provides necessary vitamins
        and nutrients. Gochujang, a traditional Korean sauce made of red pepper is also commonly used, often as pepper
        (chilli) paste, earning the cuisine a reputation for spiciness.
        <br><br>
        Bulgogi (roasted marinated meat, usually beef), galbi (marinated grilled short ribs), and samgyeopsal (pork
        belly) are popular meat entrees. Fish is also a popular commodity, as it is the traditional meat that Koreans
        eat. Meals are usually accompanied by a soup or stew, such as galbitang (stewed ribs) or doenjang jjigae
        (fermented bean paste soup). The center of the table is filled with a shared collection of sidedishes called
        banchan.
        <br><br>
        Other popular dishes include bibimbap, which literally means "mixed rice" (rice mixed with meat, vegetables, and
        red pepper paste), and naengmyeon (cold noodles).
        <br><br>
        Instant noodles, or ramyeon, is a popular snack food. Koreans also enjoy food from pojangmachas (street
        vendors), which serve tteokbokki, rice cake and fish cake with a spicy gochujang sauce; gimbap, made of steamed
        white rice wrapped in dried laver seaweed; fried squid; and glazed sweet potato. Soondae, a sausage made of
        cellophane noodles and pork blood, is widely eaten.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, some other common snacks include "Choco Pie", shrimp crackers, "bbeongtwigi" (puffed rice grains),
        and "nurungji" (slightly burnt rice). Nurungji can be eaten as it is or boiled with water to make a soup.
        Nurungji can also be eaten as a snack or a dessert.
        <br><br>
        Korea is unique among Asian countries in its use of metal chopsticks. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in
        archaeological sites belonging to the ancient Korean kingdoms of Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla.

      <h3>Chimaek</h3>

        <figcaption>Chimaek</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Chimaek (from chikin meaning "fried chicken", and maekju meaning "beer") is a pairing of fried chicken (such as
        plain and spicy) and beer, served with anju (side dishes, such as kimchi and mu) in the evening in many South
        Korean restaurants, including a number of specialazed chains. Modern chimaek is believed to have been invented
        in late 20th century, but it is hard to pinpoint the exact time and place. From the roasted chicken that
        appeared in the early 1960s to the spicy chicken that was adapted to meet Korean tastes, South Korea has
        imported and developed a growing variety of chicken dishes. While chicken was gaining popularity, a new draft
        beer which appeared in the 1970s was also becoming very popular, and it became common for the two to be combined
        as a single menu item. Demand for specialty chicken shops increased with the growing demands for chicken and
        beer. As of March 2014, Korea had 192 chicken franchise companies. About 10% of companies are known for unique
        recipes.</p>

          <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
          <li>1 cup ice water(240 mL), plus 2 tablespoons</li>
          <li>20 scallions, about 2 bunches, root trimmed</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus 2-4 teaspoons</li>
          <li>¼ lb shrimp(105 g), peeled, deveined, and halved lengthwise (butterflied)</li>
          <li>¼ lb calamari bodies(105 g), sliced into ¼-inch rings, rinsed, and patted dry</li>
          <li>2 large eggs</li>
          <li>1 red chili, thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Make the chili dipping sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together rice vinegar, sugar, garlic, and gochujang
            until smooth. Set aside until ready to use. The sauce will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator
            for up to 1 week.</li>
          <li>Make the sesame soy garlic dipping sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, rice
            vinegar, and sugar until the sugar dissolves. Add the scallions, garlic, and sesame seeds and whisk until
            well combined. Set aside until ready to use. The sauce will keep in an airtight container in the
            refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
          <li>Make the pancake batter: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, garlic
            powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Stream in the ice water and whisk until the batter is smooth, about
            1 minute.</li>
          <li>Place the scallions in a large nonstick skillet to measure, then remove from the pan and trim so the
            scallions will lie flat in the bottom of the pan.</li>
          <li>Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the skillet and heat over medium-low heat for 1–2 minutes. Arrange half
            of the trimmed scallions in a single layer in the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until softened. Slowly
            pour about ½ cup batter over the scallions, ensuring that the batter gets between each scallion and to hold
            everything together.</li>
          <li>Immediately arrange half of the shrimp and half of the squid over the batter, distributing evenly. Pour
            another ¼ cup of the batter over the seafood, and let cook for 2–5 minutes, until the batter is starting to
            set. Carefully slide a spatula under the edge of the pancake and lift up to see if the underside of the
            pancake is turning golden brown. If it is starting to burn, reduce the heat to low.</li>
          <li>Add each egg to a small bowl with ¼ teaspoon salt each. Whisk with a fork to combine.</li>
          <li>When the pancake is mostly set on top, sprinkle with half of the red chile, then pour 1 beaten egg over
            the pancake. Cook for 2–4 minutes more, until the egg is mostly set.</li>
          <li>Quickly flip the pancake, then drizzle 1–2 teaspoons of vegetable oil around the edges of the pan to
            prevent sticking. Cook the pancake for 2–3 minutes more, until the egg is fully cooked and the bottom of the
            pancake is golden brown and crispy. Set a plate over the skillet and quickly invert the pancake onto the
            plate. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make another pancake.</li>
          <li>Slice the pancakes and serve with the dipping sauces.</li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>

      </figure>
      <p>Korean BBQ (gogi-gu-i meaning "meat roast") refers to the popular method in Korean cuisine of grilling,
        typically beef, pork or chicken. Such dishes are often prepared on gas or charcoal grills built into the dining
        table itself. Some Korean restaurants that do not have built-in grills provide customers with portable stoves
        for diners to use at their tables. Alternatively, a chef uses a centrally displayed grill to prepare dishes to
        order. The most representative form of korean barbecue is bulgogi, usually made from thinly sliced marinated
        beef sirloin or tenderloin. Another popular form is galbi, made from marinated beef short ribs. However, korean
        barbecue also includes many other kinds of marinated and unmarinated meat dishes, and can be divided into
        several categories. Korean barbecue is popular in its home country, but has also gained popularity worldwide.

      </figure>
      <p>Grilled pork belly (samgyeopsal meaning "three-layer meat") or samgyeopsal-gui is a type of gui (grilled dish)
        in Korean cuisine. Thick, fatty slices of pork belly, sometimes with the skin left on and sometimes scored on
        the diagonal, are grilled on a slanted metal griddle or a gridiron at the diners' table, inset with charcoal
        grills or convex gas burners. Usually, diners grill the meat themselves, flipping and cutting them with tongs
        and scissors, and eat directly from the grill. The meat is usually neither marinated nor seasoned, although
        marinated samgyeopsal in flavors such as ginseng, wine, garlic, herbs, curry, doenjang, and gochujang has gained
        popularity since the late 2000s. Slices of garlic, onions, green chili peppers, mushrooms, and kimchi are often
        grilled alongside using the fat trickling from the pork belly. Common accompaniments for samgyeopsal include
        ssam vegetables such as lettuce, kkaennip (perilla leaves), ssammu (pickled radish paper) and dipping sauces
        such as ssamjang (made with seasoned mixture of chili paste and soy bean paste) and gireum-jang (made with
        sesame oil, salt, and black pepper), jangajji (soy sauce-pickled vegetables) such as myeongi-jangajji (pickled
        Siberian onion leaves) or yangpa-jangajji (pickled onions), kimchi, as well as sliced garlic, onions, and
        seasoned shredded scallions. Garlic, onions, and kimchi can be either grilled with the meat or consumed raw with
        the cooked meat. Mushrooms, such as button mushrooms or oyster mushrooms, are also grilled with the meat.</p>

      <p>Bokkeum-bap (fried rice) is a Korean dish made by stir-frying bap (cooked rice) with other ingredients in oil.
        The name of the most prominent ingredient other than cooked rice often appears at the very front of the name of
        the dish, as in kimchi-bokkeum-bap (kimchi fried rice). In Korean restaurants, fried rice is a popular
        end-of-meal add-on. Diners may say "bap bokka juseyo" (literally "Please fry rice.") after eating main dishes
        cooked on a tabletop stove, such as dak-galbi (spicy stir-fried chicken) or nakji-bokkeum (stir-fried octopus),
        then cooked rice along with gimgaru (seaweed flakes) and sesame oil will be added directly into the remains of
        the main dish, stir-fried and scorched.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>4 Large Eggs</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until halfway done, 3–5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Add the garlic and green onions to the center and cook until fragrant, 1–2 minutes.</li>
          <li>Make some space in the middle of the pan, add the kimchi, and cook until the juices reduce and kimchi
            starts to turn reddish brown, about 3 minutes.</li>
          <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the gochujang, mirin, soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon sesame oil. Add to the
            skillet and cook until well incorporated, about 1 minute.</li>
          <li>Add the rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until rice is warmed through and crispy on the bottom, 3–4
            minutes.</li>
          <li>Transfer the rice mixture to a deep bowl and press down with spatula to compact.</li>
          <li>Place a medium skillet over the bowl, then flip to invert the rice volcano. Lift the bowl. Use the back of
            a spoon to carefully press an indentation into the top of the volcano, then make a crevasse in the side to
            allow the cheese to flow out.</li>
          <li>In a large liquid measuring cup, whisk together the eggs.</li>
          <li>Turn the heat to medium, then pour the egg mixture over the rice volcano and top with the mozzarella
            cheese. Cover the pan and cook until the cheese is melted and the egg is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Garnish with more scallions if desired.</li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>

      <p>Bibimbap (mixed rice) is a Korean rice dish. The term "bibim" means mixing rice (burned rice at the bottom of
        the dish and cooked rice), while the "bap" noun refers to rice. Bibimbap is served as a bowl of warm white rice
        topped with namul (sautéed and seasoned vegetables) or kimchi (traditional fermented vegetables) and gochujang
        (chili pepper paste), soy sauce, or doenjang (a fermented soybean paste). A raw or fried egg and sliced meat
        (usually beef) are common additions. The hot dish is stirred together thoroughly just before eating. In South
        Korea, Jeonju, Jinju, and Tongyeong are especially famous for their versions of bibimbap.[4] In 2011, the dish
        was listed at number 40 on the World's 50 most delicious foods readers' poll compiled by CNN Travel.</p>

        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>In a shallow dish, combine 2 cloves of garlic, the ginger, 2 thinly sliced scallions, the soy sauce, 2
            tablespoons sesame oil, the mirin, and brown sugar, and whisk to combine.</li>
          <li>Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator for 30
            minutes.</li>
          <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat and season generously with salt. Prepare an ice bath in
            a large bowl. Blanch the spinach in the boiling water for 30 seconds, then transfer to the ice bath to

            still runny, or to your desired doneness.</li>
          <li>To assemble the bibimbap bowls, top the rice with the chicken, kimchi, sliced scallions, carrots, spinach,
            mushrooms, cucumbers, and fried eggs.</li>

      </figure>
      <p>Tteokbokki (simmered rice cake), is a popular Korean food made from small-sized garae-tteok (long, white,
        cylinder-shaped rice cakes) called tteokmyeon (rice cake noodles) or commonly tteokbokki-tteok (tteokbokki rice
        cakes). Eomuk (fish cakes), boiled eggs, and scallions are some common ingredients paired with tteokbokki in
        dishes. It can be seasoned with either spicy gochujang (chili paste) or non-spicy ganjang (soy sauce)-based
        sauce; the former is the most common form, while the latter is less common and sometimes called
        gungjung-tteokbokki (royal court tteokbokki). Today, variations also include curry-tteokbokki, cream
        sauce-tteokbokki, jajang-tteokbokki, seafood-tteokbokki, rose-tteokbokki, galbi-tteokbokki and so on. Tteokbokki
        is commonly purchased and eaten at bunsikjip (snack bars) as well as pojangmacha (street stalls). There are also
        dedicated restaurants for tteokbokki, where it is referred to as jeukseok tteokbokki (impromptu tteokbokki). It
        is also a popular home dish, as the rice cakes (garae-tteok) can be purchased in pre-packaged, semi-dehydrated
        form.</p>

      <p> Jjigae (korean stew) is a soup with many varieties; it is typically made with meat, seafood or vegetables in a
        broth seasoned with gochujang, doenjang, ganjang or saeujeot. Jjigae is usually served in a communal dish,
        boiling hot. A Korean meal almost always includes either a jjigae or a guk. During the Joseon dynasty, it was
        known as jochi, and two varieties would always be present on the King's surasang. The types of jjigae are often
        named according to their principal ingredients, such as saengseon jjigae made from fish or dubu jjigae made from
        tofu, or according to their broth and seasonings like gochujang jjigae or doenjang jjigae.</p>
