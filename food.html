        <h2>Korean Cuisine</h2>
        <p>Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient
          agricultural and nomadic traditions in Korea and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine reflects a complex
          interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends. Korean cuisine is largely based on rice,
          vegetables, seafood and (at least in South Korea) meats. Dairy is largely absent from the traditional Korean
          diet. Traditional Korean meals are named for the number of side dishes (반찬; 飯饌; banchan) that accompany
          steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients include sesame
          oil, doenjang (fermented bean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, gochugaru (pepper flakes), gochujang
          (fermented red chili paste) and napa cabbage. Ingredients and dishes vary by province. Many regional dishes
          have become national, and dishes that were once regional have proliferated in different variations across the
          country. Korean royal court cuisine once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal
          family. Foods are regulated by Korean cultural etiquette.</p>

        <h2>History of Korean Food</h2>
        <h3>Prehistoric</h3>
        <p>In the Jeulmun pottery period (approximately 8000 to 1500 BCE), hunter-gatherer societies engaged in fishing
          and hunting, and incipient agriculture in the later stages. Since the beginning of the Mumun pottery period
          (1500 BCE), agricultural traditions began to develop with new migrant groups from the Liao River basin of
          Manchuria. During the Mumun period, people grew millet, barley, wheat, legumes and rice, and continued to hunt
          and fish. Archaeological remains point to development of fermented beans during this period, and cultural
          contact with nomadic cultures to the north facilitated domestication of animals.</p>

        <h3>Three Kingdoms period</h3>
        <p>The Three Kingdoms period (57 BCE – 668 CE) was one of rapid cultural evolution. The kingdom of Goguryeo (37
          BCE – 668 CE) was located in the northern part of the peninsula along much of modern-day Manchuria. The second
          kingdom, Baekje (18 BCE – 660 CE), was in the southwestern portion of the peninsula, and the third, Silla (57
          BCE – 935 CE), was located at the southeastern portion of the peninsula. Each region had its own distinct set
          of cultural practices and foods. For example, Baekje was known for cold foods and fermented foods like kimchi.
          The spread of Buddhism and Confucianism through cultural exchanges with China during the fourth century CE
          began to change the distinct cultures of Korea.</p>

        <h3>Goryeo period</h3>
        <p>During the latter Goryeo period, the Mongols invaded Goryeo in the 13th century. Some traditional foods found
          today in Korea have their origins during this period. The dumpling dish, mandu, grilled meat dishes, noodle
          dishes, and the use of seasonings such as black pepper, all have their roots in this period.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="blogposts">
        <h3>Joseon period</h3>
        <p>Agricultural innovations were significant and widespread during this period, such as the invention of the
          rain gauge during the 15th century. During 1429, the government began publishing books on agriculture and
          farming techniques, which included Nongsa jikseol (literally "Straight Talk on Farming"), an agricultural book
          compiled under King Sejong.
          A series of invasions in the earlier half of the Joseon caused a dynamic shift in the culture during the
          second half of the period. Groups of silhak ("practical learning") scholars began to emphasize the importance
          of looking outside the country for innovation and technology to help improve the agricultural systems. Crops
          traded by Europeans from the New World began to appear, acquired through trade with China, Japan, Europe, and
          the Philippines; these crops included maize, sweet potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, peanuts, and squash.
          Potatoes and sweet potatoes were particularly favored as they grew in soils and on terrains that were
          previously unused. Government further developed agriculture through technology and lower taxation. Complex
          irrigation systems built by government allowed peasant farmers to produce larger crop volumes and produce
          crops not only for sustenance but also as cash crops. Reduced taxation of the peasantry also furthered the
          expanded commerce through increasing periodic markets, usually held every five days. One thousand such markets
          existed in the 19th century, and were communal centers for economic trade and entertainment. The end of the
          Joseon period was marked by consistent encouragement to trade with the Western world, China and Japan. In the
          1860s, trade agreements pushed by the Japanese government led the Joseon dynasty to open its trade ports with
          the west, and to numerous treaties with the United States, Britain, France, and other Western countries. The
          opening of Korea to the Western world brought further exchange of culture and food. Western missionaries
          introduced new ingredients and dishes to Korea. Joseon elites were introduced to these new foods by way of
          foreigners who attended the royal court as advisers or physicians. This period also saw the introduction of
          various seasonings imported from Japan via western traders and alcoholic drinks from China.</p>

        <h3>Colonial period to modern period</h3>
        <p>Japan occupied the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945. Many of its agricultural systems were taken over by
          the Japanese to support Japan's food supply. Land changes resulting from the Japanese occupation included
          combining small farms into large-scale farms, which led to larger yields. Rice production increased during
          this period to support the Japanese Empire's war efforts. Many Koreans, in turn, increased the production of
          other grains for their own consumption. Meals during the Japanese occupation were quite varied. Koreans
          usually ate two meals a day during the cold seasons, and three during the warm seasons. For the lower classes,
          satiety, rather than quality, was most important. Those in even lower economic levels were likely to enjoy
          only a single bowl of white rice each year, while the remainder of the year was filled with cheaper grains,
          such as millet and barley. For the Korean middle and upper classes during the occupation, things were quite
          different. Western foods began emerging in the Korean diet, such as white bread and commercially produced
          staples such as precooked noodles. The Japanese occupational period ended after the defeat of Japan during
          World War II. The country remained in a state of turmoil through the Korean War (1950–1953) and the Cold War,
          which separated the country into North Korea and South Korea. Both of these periods continued the limited food
          provisions for Koreans, and the stew called budae jjigae, which makes use of inexpensive meats such as sausage
          and Spam, originated during this period. At this point, the history of North and South Korea sharply diverged.
          In the 1960s under President Park Chung Hee, industrialization began to give South Korea the economic and
          cultural power it holds in the global economy today. Agriculture was increased through use of commercial
          fertilizers and modern farming equipment. In the 1970s, food shortages began to lessen. Consumption of instant
          and processed foods increased, as did the overall quality of foods. Livestock and dairy production was
          increased during the 1970s through the increase of commercial dairies and mechanized farms. The consumption of
          pork and beef increased vastly in the 1970s. Per-capita consumption of meat was 3.6 kg in 1961 and 11 kg by
          1979. The result of this increased meat consumption brought about the rise of bulgogi restaurants, which gave
          the middle class of South Korea the ability to enjoy meat regularly. Meat eating continued to rise, reaching
          40 kg in 1997, with fish consumption at 49.5 kg in 1998. Rice consumption continually decreased through these
          years, from 128 kg consumed per person in 1985 to 106 kg in 1995 and 83 kg in 2003. The decrease in rice
          consumption has been accompanied by an increase in the consumption of bread and noodles. In 2009, the South
          Korean government launched a $77-million culinary diplomacy program called "Korean Cuisine to the World" to
          promote its cuisine and subsequently pivoted into the markets in the United States and Muslim countries.</p>

        <h2>Nature’s influence on Korean cuisine</h2>
        <p>Understanding the environmental characteristics of Korea is necessary to see its influence on Korean cuisine
          and culture. Korea is located between the Chinese mainland and the islands of Japan, and it therefore shares
          many cultural characteristics with the two countries. However, its unique climate and geography have also
          produced many differences.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="blogposts">
        <h3>Geography</h3>
        <p>Korea is located on the Korean Peninsula, which extends southward from the northeastern region of the Asian
          continental landmass. It shares its border with China and Russia to the north but is otherwise surrounded by
          water, resulting in a flourishing fishing industry. Forested, mountainous terrain covers 70 percent of the
          nation, yielding a variety of wild edible greens that are also grown in dry-field farms. Korea's major rivers,
          including the Nakdong River, the Han River and the Geum River, tend to flow westward along the mountain
          ranges, creating well-developed plains in the peninsula's western region. The conditions in the western and
          southern regions of the peninsula are therefore favorable to rice farms, while dry-field farms predominate in
          the northern and eastern regions. Korea's eastern coast has a smooth coastline, but the southern and western
          coasts have jagged coastlines with many islands. This provides an ideal environment for exploiting a rich
          variety of marine products. Due to the varying geographical features and climates of the four regions of
          Korea, they have resulted in differing regional cuisines. Despite the development of transportation increasing
          contact between regions, and making local cultures less distinct, many of the unique local specialties and
          distinct styles of each province still remain.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="blogposts">"
        <h3>Climate</h3>
        <p>The climate of Korea is characterized by four distinct seasons–spring, summer, autumn and winter–yielding a
          diverse array of seasonal foods. Even the same ingredients may have different tastes and nutrients in each
          season, which produces a variety of flavor variation within recipes. Unlike the abundant food materials
          available in the hot, humid summers and clear, dry springs and autumns, cold winters see Koreans eating dried
          vegetables and kimchi instead of fresh vegetables. Jeotgal, a salted fermented fish, was developed by the
          ancestors in the southern region of Korea as a way to preserve fish for a long period of time during the cold
          winters and hot summers. However, recent climate changes have introduced a subtropical climate to the
          peninsula, changing the types of seasonal food materials available.</p>

        <h2>Food</h2>
        <h3>Grains</h3>
        <p>Grains have been one of the most important staples of the Korean diet. Early myths of the foundations of
          various kingdoms in Korea center on grains. One foundation myth relates to Jumong, who received barley seeds
          from two doves sent by his mother after establishing the kingdom of Goguryeo. Yet another myth speaks of the
          three founding deities of Jeju Island, who were to be wed to the three princesses of Tamna; the deities
          brought seeds of five grains which were the first seeds planted, which in turn became the first instance of
          farming. During the pre-modern era, grains such as barley and millet were the main staples. They were
          supplemented by wheat, sorghum, and buckwheat. Rice is not an indigenous crop to Korea and millet was likely
          the preferred grain before rice was cultivated. Rice became the grain of choice during the Three Kingdoms
          period, particularly in the Silla and Baekje Kingdoms in the southern regions of the peninsula. Rice was such
          an important commodity in Silla that it was used to pay taxes. The Sino-Korean word for "tax" is a compound
          character that uses the character for the rice plant. The preference for rice escalated into the Joseon
          period, when new methods of cultivation and new varieties emerged that would help increase production. As rice
          was prohibitively expensive when it first came to Korea, the grain was likely mixed with other grains to
          "stretch" the rice; this is still done in dishes such as boribap (rice with barley) and kongbap (rice with
          beans). White rice, which is rice with the bran removed, has been the preferred form of rice since its
          introduction into the cuisine. The most traditional method of cooking the rice has been to cook it in an iron
          pot called a sot (솥) or musoe sot (무쇠솥). This method of rice cookery dates back to at least the Goryeo period,
          and these pots have even been found in tombs from the Silla period. The sot is still used today, much in the
          same manner as it was in the past centuries. Rice is used to make a number of items, outside of the
          traditional bowl of plain white rice. It is commonly ground into a flour and used to make rice cakes called
          tteok in over two hundred varieties. It is also cooked down into a congee (juk) or gruel (mieum) and mixed
          with other grains, meat, or seafood. Koreans also produce a number of rice wines, both in filtered and
          unfiltered versions. And for centuries, grains have also been used to make misu and misu-garu, drinks made
          from grain powder that are sometimes used as meal supplements.</p>

        <h3>Fruits</h3>
        <p>Encompassing a wide range of temperate climates, the Korean peninsula supports the growth of many cultivated
          and wild fruit species. Asian pears of numerous varieties, apples, melons and berries and more are typical of
          summer and fall produce.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="blogposts">
        <h3>Legumes</h3>
        <p>Legumes have been significant crops in Korean history and cuisine, according to the earliest preserved
          legumes found in archaeological sites in Korea. The excavation at Okbang site, Jinju, South Gyeongsang
          province indicates soybeans were cultivated as a food crop circa 1000–900 BCE. They are still made into dubu
          (tofu), while soybean sprouts are sauteed as a vegetable (kongnamul) and whole soybeans are seasoned and
          served as a side dish. They are also made into soy milk, which is used as the base for the noodle dish called
          kongguksu. A byproduct of soy milk production is biji or kong-biji, which is used to thicken stews and
          porridges. Soybeans may also be one of the beans in kongbap, boiled together with several types of beans and
          other grains, and they are also the primary ingredient in the production of fermented condiments collectively
          referred to as jang, such as soybean pastes, doenjang and cheonggukjang, a soy sauce called ganjang, chili
          pepper paste or gochujang and others. Nokdu (Mung bean) is commonly used in Korean cuisine. Sukju namuls (Mung
          bean sprouts) are often served as a side dish, blanched and sautéed with sesame oil, garlic, and salt. Ground
          Nokdu is used to make a porridge called nokdujuk, which is eaten as a nutritional supplement and digestive
          aid, especially for ill patients. A popular snack, bindaetteok (mung bean pancake), is made with ground nokdu
          and fresh sukju namul. Starch extracted from ground nokdu is used to make transparent dangmyeon ( cellophane
          noodles). The dangmyeons are the main ingredients for japchae (a salad-like dish) and sundae (a blood
          sausage), and are a subsidiary ingredient for soups and stews. The starch can be also used to make jelly-like
          foods, such as nokdumuk and hwangpomuk. The muk have a bland flavor, so are served seasoned with soy sauce,
          sesame oil and crumbled seaweed or other seasonings such as tangpyeongchae. Cultivation of azuki beans dates
          back to ancient times according to an excavation from Odong-ri, Hoeryong, North Hamgyong Province, which is
          assumed to be that of Mumun period (approximately 1500–300 BCE). Azuki beans are generally eaten as patbap,
          which is a bowl of rice mixed with the beans, or as a filling and covering for tteok (rice cake) and breads. A
          porridge made with azuki beans, called patjuk, is commonly eaten during the winter season. On Dongjinal, a
          Korean traditional holiday which falls on December 22, Korean people eat donji patjuk, which contains saealsim
          (새알심), a ball made from glutinous rice flour. In old Korean tradition, patjuk is believed to have the power to
          drive evil spirits away.</p>

        <h3>Condiments and seasoning</h3>
        <p>Condiments are divided into fermented and nonfermented variants. Fermented condiments include ganjang,
          doenjang, gochujang and vinegars. Nonfermented condiments or spices include red pepper, black pepper,
          cordifolia, mustard, chinensis, garlic, onion, ginger, leek, and scallion (spring onion).</p>
      </article>

      <article class="blogposts">
        <h3>Gochujang</h3>
        <p>Gochujang can be found in many writings. Some of the writings are the Mangi Yoram, The Three States, the
          Nonggawolryeongga, the Gijaejapgi, and the Hyangyak-jipsongbang. The Hyangyak-jipseongbang, which dates back
          to around 1433 during the Chosun dynasty, is one of the oldest writings mentioning gochujang. Gochujang is a
          fermented bean paste that has red pepper powder, soybean powder and rice flour added to it to create a spicy
          paste. It typically can be added to most dishes. Gochujang can be used as a seasoning and sometimes as a
          dipping sauce. Many variations come from jang, fermented bean paste. Some variations can include doenjang
          (soybean and brine), kanjang (soybeans, water, and salt), chogochujang (gochujang and vinegar), and jeotgal
          (mixture of other jangs and seafoods). Vegetables such as cucumbers, carrots, and cabbage use gochujang as a
          dip. Gochujang is a common seasoning for foods such as Korean barbecue including pork and beef. One popular
          snack food that is very commonly eaten with gochujang is bibimbap. Bibimbap includes rice, spinach, radish,
          bean sprouts. Sometimes beef is added to bibimbap. Another popular dish including gochujang is tteokbokki.
          Gochujang was believed to revitalize people who were sick with colds or exhaustion during the Gio period.
          There have been some studies that show that red peppers fight obesity and diabetes. Gochujang is also added to
          many foods so that there can be additional nutritional value with each meal.</p>

      <article class="blogposts">
        <h3>Meat</h3>
        <p>In antiquity, most meat in Korea was likely obtained through hunting and fishing. Ancient records indicate
          rearing of livestock began on a small scale during the Three Kingdoms period. Meat was consumed roasted or in
          soups or stews during this period. Those who lived closer to the oceans were able to complement their diet
          with more fish, while those who lived in the interior had a diet containing more meat.
          <br><br>
          Beef is the most prized of all, with the cattle holding an important cultural role in the Korean home. Beef is
          prepared in numerous ways today, including roasting, grilling (gui) or boiling in soups. Beef can also be
          dried into yukpo, a type of po, as with seafood, called eopo. The cattle were valuable draught animals, often
          seen as equal to human servants, or in some cases, members of the family. Cattle were also given their own
          holiday during the first 'cow' day of the lunar New Year. The importance of cattle does not suggest Koreans
          ate an abundance of beef, however, as the cattle were valued as beasts of burden and slaughtering one would
          create dire issues in farming the land. Pork and seafood were consumed more regularly for this reason. The
          Buddhist ruling class of the Goryeo period forbade the consumption of beef. The Mongols dispensed with the ban
          of beef during the 13th century, and they promoted the production of beef cattle. This increased production
          continued into the Joseon period, when the government encouraged both increased quantities and quality of
          beef. Only in the latter part of the 20th century has beef become regular table fare.
          <br><br>
          Chicken has played an important role as a protein in Korean history, evidenced by a number of myths. One myth
          tells of the birth of Kim Alji, founder of the Kim family of Gyeongju being announced by the cry of a white
          chicken. As the birth of a clan's founder is always announced by an animal with preternatural qualities, this
          myth speaks to the importance of chicken in Korean culture. Chicken is often served roasted or braised with
          vegetables or in soups. All parts of the chicken are used in Korean cuisine, including the gizzard, liver, and
          feet. Young chickens are braised with ginseng and other ingredients in medicinal soups eaten during the summer
          months to combat heat called samgyetang. The feet of the chicken, called dakbal (닭발), are often roasted and
          covered with hot and spicy gochujang-based sauce and served as an anju, or side dish, to accompany alcoholic
          beverages, especially soju.
          <br><br>
          Pork has also been another important land-based protein for Korea. Records indicate pork has been a part of
          the Korean diet back to antiquity, similar to beef. A number of foods have been avoided while eating pork,
          including Chinese bellflower (doraji, 도라지) and lotus root (yeonn ppuri, 연뿌리), as the combinations have been
          thought to cause diarrhea. All parts of the pig are used in Korean cuisine, including the head, intestines,
          liver, kidney and other internal organs. Koreans utilize these parts in a variety of cooking methods including
          steaming, stewing, boiling and smoking. Koreans especially like to eat grilled pork belly, which is called
          samgyeopsal (삼겹살, 三--).
          <br><br>
          Fish and shellfish have been a major part of Korean cuisine because of the oceans bordering the peninsula.
          Evidence from the 12th century illustrates commoners consumed a diet mostly of fish and shellfish, such as
          shrimp, clams, oysters, abalone, and loach, while sheep and hogs were reserved for the upper class. Both fresh
          and saltwater fish are popular, and are served raw, grilled, broiled, dried or served in soups and stews.
          Common grilled fish include mackerel, hairtail, croaker and Pacific herring. Smaller fish, shrimp, squid,
          mollusks and countless other seafood can be salted and fermented as jeotgal. Fish can also be grilled either
          whole or in fillets as banchan. Fish is often dried naturally to prolong storing periods and enable shipping
          over long distances. Fish commonly dried include yellow corvina, anchovies (myeolchi) and croaker. Dried
          anchovies, along with kelp, form the basis of common soup stocks. Shellfish is widely eaten in all different
          types of preparation. They can be used to prepare broth, eaten raw with chogochujang, which is a mixture of
          gochujang and vinegar, or used as a popular ingredient in countless dishes. Raw oysters and other seafood
          can be used in making kimchi to improve and vary the flavor. Salted baby shrimp are used as a seasoning agent,
          known as saeujeot, for the preparation of some types of kimchi. Large shrimp are often grilled as daeha gui
          (대하구이) or dried, mixed with vegetables and served with rice. Mollusks eaten in Korean cuisine include octopus,
          cuttlefish, and squid.

        <h3>Vegetables</h3>
        <p>Korean cuisine uses a wide variety of vegetables, which are often served uncooked, either in salads or
          pickles, as well as cooked in various stews, stir-fried dishes, and other hot dishes. Commonly used vegetables
          include Korean radish, napa cabbage, cucumber, potato, sweet potato, spinach, bean sprouts, scallions, garlic,
          chili peppers, seaweed, zucchini, mushrooms, lotus root. Several types of wild greens, known collectively as
          chwinamul (such as Aster scaber), are a popular dish, and other wild vegetables such as bracken fern shoots
          (gosari) or Korean bellflower root (doraji) are also harvested and eaten in season. Traditional medicinal
          herbs in Korean cuisine, such as ginseng, lingzhi mushroom, wolfberry, Codonopsis pilosula, and Angelica
          sinensis, are often used as ingredients in cooking, as in samgyetang.</p>

        <h3>Medicinal foods</h3>
        <p>Medicinal food (boyangshik) is a wide variety of specialty foods prepared and eaten for their purported
          medicinal purposes, especially during the hottest 30-day period in the lunar calendar, called sambok. Hot
          foods consumed are believed to restore ki, as well as sexual and physical stamina lost in the summer heat.
          Commonly eaten boyangshik include ginseng, chicken, black goat, abalone, eel, carp, beef bone soups and pig

        <h3>Samgyetang (삼계탕)-Ginseng chicken soup</h3>
        <p>Samgyetang is a chicken ginseng soup traditionally consumed during Boknal (복날) days: the hottest days of
          summer. It is a Korean custom to eat hot food in hot weather called Iyeolchiyeol (이열치열), which means
          “controlling heat with heat”. Consequently, Samgyetang is Koreans' favorite energizing food and it is common
          to have it on sambok (삼복) days — Chobok (초복), Jungbok (중복) and Malbok (말복) — which are believed to be the
          hottest days in Korea. As the “Dongui Bogam” says, (Kor. 동의보감, Chin. 東醫寶鑑, Exemplar of Korean Medicine, 1613),
          “eating the meat from a female chicken with yellow feathers helps to control excessive thirst and urination,
          vitalizes the five viscera, increases yang energy, and warms the small intestines…. Ginseng complements the
          five viscera, stabilizes the spirit and soul, and fills what is lacking and weak in our body.”↵It is served
          with radish kimchi, cabbage kimchi, chicken gizzard, fresh green peppers and ginseng wine (insamju -인삼주).
          Commonly, it uses a chicken before the age of six months before it start to lay eggs. Stew made from a young
          chicken served with yukgaejang (Kor. 육개장, spicy beef stew), were introduced as part of the (복날) ‘Canicular
          Days’ cuisine only in the early 20th century. Originally, samgyetang was called gyesamtang then it changed
          because of the increasingly popularity of ginseng in Korea and overseas. That is also because as ginseng is
          the main ingredient of the soup Korean decided to reverse the first two syllables of the name putting ginseng
          first.</p>

        <h2>Dishes</h2>
        <p>Korean foods can be largely categorized into groups of "main staple foods" (주식), "subsidiary dishes" (부식),
          and "dessert" (후식). The main dishes are made from grains such as bap (a bowl of rice), juk (porridge), and
          guksu (noodles). Many Korean banchan rely on fermentation for flavor and preservation, resulting in a tangy,
          salty, and spicy taste. Certain regions are especially associated with some dishes (for example, the city of
          Jeonju with bibimbap) either as a place of origin or for a famous regional variety. Restaurants will often use
          these famous names on their signs or menus (e.g. "Suwon galbi").</p>

        <h3>Soups and stews</h3>
        <p>Soups are a common part of any Korean meal. Unlike other cultures, in Korean culture, soup is served as part
          of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal, as an accompaniment to rice along with
          other banchan. Soups known as guk are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Soups can be made into
          more formal soups known as tang, often served as the main dish of the meal. Jjigae are a thicker, heavier
          seasoned soups or stews. Some popular types of soups are:
        <ul>
          <li>Malgeunguk (맑은국), are flavored with ganjang. Small amounts of long boiled meat may be added to the soup,
            or seafood both fresh and dried may be added, or vegetables may be the main component for the clear soup.
          </li>
          <li>Doenjang-guk (된장국) are seasoned with doenjang. Common ingredients for tojang guk include seafood such as
            clams, dried anchovies, and shrimp. For a spicier soup, gochujang is added.</li>
          <li>Tteok-guk is a rice cake soup commonly made with sliced rice cakes and beef broth. White rice cake was
            called Baekbyeong (백병-白餠) or Geomo (거모-擧摸). Tteok-guk is made with thinly sliced garae-tteok, are long,
            cylindrical shaped rice cakes made with rice flour. Tteok-guk is boiled in chicken broth, but was originally
            boiled in pheasant meat soup. It says, “hunting pheasant is not easy, and since they breed chickens, they
            use chicken instead of pheasant, and if there’s not chicken they even used beef”(꿩 대신 닭). In North Korea,
            there is a variation of this recipe called joraengi tteokguk where rice cakes are made in the shape of
            balls. it is eaten on New Year's Day because Koreans believe that if you eat a bowl of tteok-guk on the
            first of the lunar year, you get one year older. There is the belief that rice cakes in oval shape bring
            fortune since they resemble old Korean coins known as yeopjeon (엽전).</li>
          <li>Gomguk (곰국) or gomtang (곰탕), and they are made from boiling beef bones or cartilage. Originating as a
            peasant dish, all parts of beef are used, including tail, leg and rib bones with or without meat attached;
            these are boiled in water to extract fat, marrow, and gelatin to create a rich soup. Some versions of this
            soup may also use the beef head and intestines. The only seasoning generally used in the soup is salt.</li>
          <li>Naengguk (냉국), which are cold soups generally eaten during the summer months to cool the diner. A light
            hand is usually used in the seasoning of these soups usually using ganjang and sesame oil.</li>
          <li>Shin-son-ro (or koo-ja tang), the name of it came from its special cook pot with chimney for burning
            charcoal. The meaning is a hearth or furnace or a pot for fire or incense burning that always contains
            nineteen fillings. The nineteen fillings were including beef, fish, eggs, carrot, mushrooms, and onion.</li>
          <li>Seaweed soup (miyeok-guk; 미역국).This soup is made of dried miyeok or seaweed according to 조선요리제법, it says
            it is usually made by frying 미역 with beef pouring water and making the soup. Adding mussel can make it taste
            better. Also in coastal areas they use fish instead of beef too. It is usually consumed on Koreans birthday,
            specifically on samchil day (삼칠일: a resting period after giving birth to the newborn); baek-il (백일: the
            100th day after a baby is born); doljanchi (돌잔치: the baby's first birthday).</li>
        </ul>
        Stews are referred to as jjigae, and are often a shared side dish. Jjigae is often both cooked and served in the
        glazed earthenware pot (ttukbaegi) in which it is cooked. The most common version of this stew is doenjang
        jjigae, which is a stew of soybean paste, with many variations; common ingredients include vegetables, saltwater
        or freshwater fish, and tofu. The stew often changes with the seasons and which ingredients are available. Other
        common varieties of jjigae contain kimchi (kimchi jjigae) or tofu (sundubu jjigae).</p>

        <h3>Kimchi</h3>
        <p>Kimchi refers to often fermented vegetable dishes usually made with napa cabbage, Korean radish, or sometimes
          cucumber. There are 4 types of raw materials which are major ones: spices, seasonings, and other additional
          materials. Red and black pepper, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, onion, and mustard are the example of spices. There
          are endless varieties with regional variations, and it is served as a side dish or cooked into soups and rice
          dishes. In the late 15th century, it depicted Korean's custom that Korean ancestors buried kimchi jars in the
          ground for storage for the entire winter season, as fermented foods can keep for several years. These were
          stored in traditional Korean mud pots known as jangdokdae, although with the advent of refrigerators, special
          kimchi freezers and commercially produced kimchi, this practice has become less common. Kimchi is a
          vegetable-based food which includes low calorie, low fat, and no cholesterol. Also, it is a rich source of
          various vitamins and minerals. It contains vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, and vitamin K and
          minerals which are calcium, iron, phosphorus, and selenium. South Koreans eat an average of 40 pounds of
          kimchi each year.</p>

        <h3>Noodles</h3>
        <p>Noodles or noodle dishes in Korean cuisine are collectively referred to as guksu in native Korean or myeon in
          hanja. While noodles were eaten in Korea from ancient times, productions of wheat was less than other crops,
          so wheat noodles did not become a daily food until 1945. Wheat noodles (milguksu) were specialty foods for
          birthdays, weddings or auspicious occasions because the long and continued shape were thought to be associated
          with the bliss for longevity and long-lasting marriage. In Korean traditional noodle dishes are onmyeon or
          guksu jangguk (noodles with a hot clear broth), naengmyeon (cold buckwheat noodles), bibim guksu (cold noodle
          dish mixed with vegetables), kalguksu (knife-cut noodles), kongguksu (noodles with a cold soybean broth),
          japchae (cellophane noodles made from sweet potato with various vegetables) and others. In royal court,
          baekmyeon (literally "white noodles") consisting of buckwheat noodles and pheasant broth, was regarded as the
          top quality noodle dish. Naengmyeon with a cold soup mixed with dongchimi (watery radish kimchi) and beef
          brisket broth was eaten in court during summer.
        <ul>
          <li>Jajangmyeon, a staple Koreanized Chinese noodle dish, is extremely popular in Korea as fast, take-out
            food. It is made with a black bean sauce usually fried with diced pork or seafood and a variety of
            vegetables, including zucchini and potatoes. It is popularly ordered and delivered, like Chinese take-out
            food in other parts of the world.</li>
          <li>Ramyeon refers to Korean instant noodles similar to ramen.</li>
          <li>Japchae (잡채; 雜菜) is a dish made by inserting in boiling water roasted vegetables, mushrooms and meat, each
            of them roasted. This is one of the most popular dishes in Korean tradition enjoyed on special occasion like
            weddings, holidays and birthday. There are two types of Japchae, one that includes glass noodles and another
            without noodles. According to the Korean cookbook Diminbang 음식디미방 (around 1670), there's only the recipe
            without glass noodles. The original recipe without glass noodles is made by boiling vegetables such as
            cucumbers, pine mushrooms bean, sprouts, bellflowers green onion, then they are sprinkled with ginger,
            pepper, sesame oil, and flour. The sauce is made by boiling minced pink meat and soybean paste that is
            lightly filtered with sesame oil and flour. To match the name more than 20 ingredients were used. In Gyongon
            Yoram [규곤요람閨壼要覽 (1896)] is also recorded japchae seasoned with mustard sauce without glass noodles. However,
            since the 1930s, appears the japchae recipe with glass noodles alongside the original recipe. Also, during
            the Joseon dynasty [조선요리법朝鮮料理法] the recipe of japchae, with and without glass noodles, was added to the
            cookbook. Also, there is also a variant of japchae with meat, or one with abalone or other seafood in
            1930s.It is a local food that shows the traditional recipe. In the Jinju region, Jamung-sam, Yokimun, is a
            local dish with soy sauce and sesame oil, and the seafood, such as octopus, skates, and mixed several
            vegetables stained in oil. Because it uses various ingredients, it has high calorie, protein, fat, vitamin,
            mineral, and sufficient nutritional. It is the first item to choose when you want a feast table.</li>

        <h3>Banchan</h3>
        <p>Banchan is a term referring collectively to side dishes in Korean cuisine. Soups and stews are not considered
          banchan. Gui are grilled dishes, which most commonly have meat or fish as their primary ingredient, but may in
          some cases also comprise grilled vegetables or other vegetable ingredients. At traditional restaurants, meats
          are cooked at the center of the table over a charcoal grill, surrounded by various banchan and individual rice
          bowls. The cooked meat is then cut into small pieces and wrapped with fresh lettuce leaves, with rice, thinly
          sliced garlic, ssamjang (a mixture of gochujang and dwenjang), and other seasonings. The suffix gui is often
          omitted in the names of meat-based gui such as galbi, the name of which was originally galbi gui. Jjim and
          seon (steamed dishes) are generic terms referring to steamed or boiled dishes in Korean cuisine. However, the
          former is made with meat or seafood-based ingredients marinated in gochujang or ganjang while seon is made
          with vegetable stuffed with fillings. Hoe (raw dishes): although the term originally referred to any kind of
          raw dish, it is generally used to refer to saengseonhweh (생선회, raw fish dishes). It is dipped in gochujang, or
          soy sauce with wasabi, and served with lettuce or perilla leaves. Jeon (전, 煎) (or buchimgae) is a Korean
          savory pancake made from various ingredients. Chopped kimchi or seafood is mixed into a wheat flour-based
          batter, and then pan fried. This dish is typically dipped in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, and red pepper
          powder. It can be served as an appetizer, side dish (banchan - 반찬) or accompanied by alcohol (anju - 안주).
          There are some sweet varieties called Hwajeon (화전) which means flower pancakes. There are different types of
          jeon: jeon-yu [전유어(煎油魚)] and jeon-hwa [전유화(煎油花)], the former has recently developed to only refer to fish
          pancakes. The previous ingredients can be used in various ways, such as meat, fish, and vegetables. The meat
          used can be quail, beef and pork. Seafood is mainly white sea fish such as croaker, cod, and Pollack.
          Vegetables used are: pumpkins, pepper,sesame leaves etc. In the summer potatoes are harvested, and the mung
          beans are made in the winter. According to the regional cases many buckwheat production are in Pyeongchang and
          Bongpyeong area, first set the small green onions or cabbage leaves and turn the thin buckwheat dough on it.
          There is no special taste, but the hands are still in the hand of buckwheat. Cooking oils such as soy and corn
          are used today, though technology required for producing these oils was not available during the Joseon
          dynasty. Namul may refer to either saengchae (생채, literally "fresh vegetables") or sukchae (숙채, literally
          "heated vegetables"), although the term generally indicates the latter. Saengchae is mostly seasoned with
          vinegar, chili pepper powder and salt to give a tangy and refreshing taste. On the other hand, sukchae (숙채) is
          blanched and seasoned with soy sauce, sesame oil, chopped garlic, or sometimes chili pepper powder.</p>

        <h3>Anju (side dishes accompanying alcoholic beverages)</h3>
        <p>Anju is a general term for a Korean side dish consumed with alcohol. It matches well with Korean traditional
          alcohol such as Soju or Makgeolli and helps people to enjoy their drinking more. Some examples of anju include
          steamed squid with gochujang, assorted fruit, dubu kimchi (tofu with kimchi), peanuts, odeng/ohmuk, sora (소라)
          (a kind of shellfish popular in street food tents), and nakji (small octopus) and Jokbal (pig's leg served
          with salted shrimp sauce). Samgyupsal (pork belly) is also considered as Anju with Soju. Most Korean foods can
          be considered as 'anju', as the food consumed alongside the alcohol depends on the diner's taste and
          preferences.</p>

        <h3>Songpyeon (송편)</h3>
        <p>Songpyeon (송편, 松䭏) is a Korean dish made of rice powder mostly eaten during Chuseok/ Korean thanksgiving (추석)
          to express gratitude towards ancestors. Songpyeon recordings appear from the 17th century. It is said in
          『Yorok 要 錄』, "Make rice cakes with white rice flour, steam them with pine and pine needles and wash them off
          with water." At the beginning of Songpyeon, rice cakes were made simply with white rice powder, pine needles
          were steamed and then washed in water. It is said that "red beans, pine nuts, walnuts, ginger and cinnamon"
          were added in the "Buyin Pilji 婦人 必 知". In 『Korean Rice Cakes, Hangwa, Eumcheongryu』, “In mountainous regions
          such as Gangwon-do and Chungcheong-do, potato songpyeon, acorn songpyeon and songgisongpyeon have been
          prepared and eaten. In the coastal areas of Hamgyeong-do, Pyeongan-do and Gyeonggi-do, shellfish songpyeon as
          produced and eaten, and in the southern regions of Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do, songpyeon with moss leaves was
          produced and eaten. Songpyeon represents the moon and hope, which is why while eating this Koreans make
          wishes. There is a proverb that says, "When virgins make a nice songpyeon, they will meet a good spouse, and
          when a pregnant woman makes a nice songpyeon, they have beautiful daughters." Songpyeon served on the
          Baekilsang and the stone table is described in Yorok, "I cooked it so that the convex shaped part of songpyeon
          came out without adding any filling, but it looks like it is full. It has the meaning of wishing good luck. In
          the Seoul region, the floral songpyeon and five-color songpyeon were made small and beautiful, and in
          Hwanghae-do and Gangwon-do they fingerprinted and ate them coarsely. The method of making five-color songpyeon
          is achieved by adding natural ingredients such as mugwort, gardenia water, omija water and cinnamon powder to
          the rice flour, kneading the rice cake with the five colors and adding the filling. However, in the past, pine
          endodermis were used in place of cinnamon powder to make the dough brown.</p>

        <h2>Beverages</h2>
        <h3>Non-alcoholic beverages</h3>
        <p>All Korean traditional nonalcoholic beverages are referred to as eumcheong or eumcheongnyu (음청류 飮淸類) which
          literally means "clear beverages". According to historical documents regarding Korean cuisine, 193 items of
          eumcheongnyu are recorded. Eumcheongnyu can be divided into the following categories: tea, hwachae (fruit
          punch), sikhye (sweet rice drink), sujeonggwa (persimmon punch), tang (탕, boiled water), jang (장, fermented
          grain juice with a sour taste), suksu (숙수, beverage made of herbs), galsu (갈수, drink made of fruit extract,
          and Oriental medicine), honeyed water, juice and milk by their ingredient materials and preparation methods.
          Among the varieties, tea, hwachae, sikhye, and sujeonggwa are still widely favored and consumed; however, the
          others almost disappeared by the end of the 20th century. In Korean cuisine, tea, or cha, refers to various
          types of herbal tea that can be served hot or cold. Not necessarily related to the leaves, leaf buds, and
          internodes of the Camellia sinensis plant, they are made from diverse substances, including fruits (e.g.

        <h3>Alcoholic beverages</h3>
        <p>While soju is the best known liquor, there are well over 100 different alcoholic beverages, such as beers,
          rice and fruit wines, and liquors produced in South Korea as well as a sweet rice drink. The top-selling
          domestic beers (maekju in Korean) are lagers, which differ from Western beers in that they are brewed from
          rice, rather than barley. Consequently, Korean beers are lighter, sweeter and have less head than their
          Western counterparts. The South Korean beer market is dominated by the two major breweries: Hite and OB.
          Taedonggang is a North Korean beer produced at a brewery based in Pyongyang since 2002. Microbrewery beers and
          bars are growing in popularity after 2002. Soju is a clear spirit which was originally made from grain,
          especially rice, and is now also made from sweet potatoes or barley. Soju made from grain is considered
          superior (as is also the case with grain vs. potato vodka). Soju is around 22% ABV, and is a favorite beverage
          of hard-up college students, hard-drinking businessmen, and blue-collar workers. Yakju is a refined pure
          liquor fermented from rice, with the best known being cheongju. Takju is a thick unrefined liquor made with
          grains, with the best known being makgeolli, a white, milky rice wine traditionally drunk by farmers. In
          addition to the rice wine, various fruit wines and herbal wines exist in Korean cuisine. Acacia, maesil plum,
          Chinese quince, cherry, pine cone, and pomegranate are most popular. Majuang wine (a blended wine of Korean
          grapes with French or American wines) and ginseng-based wines are also available.</p>

        <p>Traditional rice cakes, tteok and Korean confectionery hangwa are eaten as treats during holidays and
          festivals. Tteok refers to all kinds of rice cakes made from either pounded rice (메떡, metteok), pounded
          glutinous rice (찰떡, chaltteok), or glutinous rice left whole, without pounding. It is served either filled or
          covered with sweetened mung bean paste, red bean paste, mashed red beans, raisins, a sweetened filling made
          with sesame seeds, sweet pumpkin, beans, jujubes, pine nuts or honey). Tteok is usually served as dessert or
          as a snack. Among varieties, songpyeon is a chewy stuffed tteok served at Chuseok. Honey or another soft sweet
          material such as sweetened sesame or black beans are used as fillings. Pine needles can be used for imparting
          flavor during the steaming process. Yaksik is a sweet rice cake made with glutinous rice, chestnuts, pine
          nuts, jujubes, and other ingredients, while chapssaltteok is a tteok filled with sweet bean paste. On the
          other hand, hangwa is a general term referring to all types of Korean traditional confectionery. The
          ingredients of hahngwa mainly consist of grain flour, honey, yeot, and sugar, or of fruit and edible roots.
          Hangwa is largely divided into yumilgwa (fried confectionery), suksilgwa, jeonggwa, gwapyeon, dasik (tea food)
          and yeot. Yumilgwa is made by stir frying or frying pieces of dough, such as maejakgwa and yakgwa. Maejakgwa
          is a ring-shaped confection made of wheat flour, vegetable oil, cinnamon, ginger juice, jocheong, and pine
          nuts, while yakgwa, literally "medicinal confectionery", is a flower-shaped biscuit made of honey, sesame oil
          and wheat flour. Suksilgwa is made by boiling fruits, ginger, or nuts in water, and then forming the mix into
          the original fruit's shape, or other shapes. Gwapyeon is a jelly-like confection made by boiling sour fruits,
          starch, and sugar. Dasik, literally "eatery for tea", is made by kneading rice flour, honey, and various types
          of flour from nuts, herbs, sesame, or jujubes. Jeonggwa, or jeongwa, is made by boiling fruits, plant roots
          and seeds in honey, mullyeot (물엿, liquid candy) or sugar. It is similar to marmalade or jam/jelly. Yeot is a
          Korean traditional candy in liquid or solid form made from steamed rice, glutinous rice, glutinous kaoliang,
          corn, sweet potatoes or mixed grains. The steamed ingredients are lightly fermented and boiled in a large pot
          called sot (솥) for a long time. Yugwa(유과) and Yak-gwa(약과).They are traditional desserts enjoyed during
          Chuseok, marriage or the sixtieth birthday (Hwangap - 환갑). Yugwa is a generic name for 산자, 강정 and 빈사과. They
          are classified as: square shaped 산자, finger shaped 강정, drop shaped and square shaped 빈사과 . Furthermore, many
          different names have been given based on coatings, toppings and fillings. Plum blossoms obtained by frying
          sesame seeds and nutmeg, steamed dried and fried glutinous rice, sebann with finely chopped sesame seeds,
          seunggeomcho and pine nut powder are used. In addition, they are dyed pink, yellow, etc. Depending on the
          region, it is also called Gwajul or Sanja. First, soak some good glutinous rice in water and let it ferment so
          that the glutinous rice sticks. The fermentation period varies from one week to ten days depending on the
          season, and after having fermented until crushed by hand, knead and steam it for a long time, then beat until
          cherries form. Sanja is a large square shape, gangjeong is the thickness of a finger and bell gangjeong is the
          size of a thumb. 빈사과 is one the size of a red bean, which is lumped together with the syrup or sugar syrup and
          cut into squares. Once the excess oil has been removed, honey or syrup is applied and the ginger juice is
          added at this time. Ginger juice has the effect of preventing rancidity of fats. It is completed by covering
          with various types of gluten wheat. Yugwa, which is difficult to make, is best prepared in the winter. Honey
          or syrup is an important ingredient in making Yugwa, which crumbles and melts when you put it in your
          mouth.↵During the Joseon dynasty, Yugwa was used during the rite of passage and in the royal family various
          types of Yugwa were placed high on the banquet table. In the aristocratic family, it is customary to send
          gangjeong to accompany the groom or to business guests returning from a wedding party to the bride's house,
          full of dongguri intertwined with stones or willows.↵Furthermore, Yugwa was chosen as the ancestral food par
          excellence for the ancestors, and is a food not to be missed during the Lunar New Year holiday. Yakgwa (약과;
          藥菓) is a dessert made of wheat flour, honey, ginger juice and rice wine. In premodern Korea they were enjoyed
          by upper classes as a rare dish, today is common to serve it with tea. Yakgwa is a traditional and good
          quality dish with a sweet and savory taste. In Korean, the Yak character is used to name foods that commonly
          contain honey and sesame oil. From ancient times, instead of fruit, honey and sesame oil were used to medicate
          and it has become a sweet. Even today the yakgwa among the bourgeois class is a dish that can never be
          missing. However, they are not prepared with difficulty as in ancient times and are easily found on the
          market. You can buy them anywhere easily and enjoy them comfortably for a snack. The Yakgwa was developed as a
          Buddhist banquet and was a very important ancestral food, it was food that was given as a gift for weddings.
          Also this reputation spread nationwide from China, Koryeo's oil and honey pastry was generally known for
          festivities.</p>

        <h2>Regional and variant cuisines</h2>
        <p>Korean regional cuisines (Korean: hyangto eumsik, literally "native local foods") are characterized by local
          specialties and distinctive styles within Korean cuisine. The divisions reflected historical boundaries of the
          provinces where these food and culinary traditions were preserved until modern times. Although Korea has been
          divided into two nation-states since 1948 (North Korea and South Korea), it was once divided into eight
          provinces (paldo) according to the administrative districts of the Joseon dynasty. The northern region
          consisted of Hamgyeong Province, Pyeongan Province and Hwanghae Province. The central region comprised
          Gyeonggi Province, Chungcheong Province, and Gangwon Province. Gyeongsang Province and Jeolla Province made up
          the southern region. Until the late 19th century, transportation networks were not well developed, and each
          provincial region preserved its own characteristic tastes and cooking methods. Geographic differences are also
          reflected by the local specialty foodstuffs depending on the climate and types of agriculture, as well as the
          natural foods available. With the modern development of transportation and the introduction of foreign foods,
          Korean regional cuisines have tended to overlap and integrate. However, many unique traditional dishes in
          Korean regional cuisine have been handed down through the generations.</p>

        <h3>Buddhist cuisine</h3>
        <p>Korean temple cuisine originated in Buddhist temples of Korea. Since Buddhism was introduced into Korea,
          Buddhist traditions have strongly influenced Korean cuisine, as well. During the Silla period (57 BCE – 935
          CE), chalbap (찰밥, a bowl of cooked glutinous rice) yakgwa (a fried dessert) and yumilgwa (a fried and puffed
          rice snack) were served for Buddhist altars and have been developed into types of hangwa, Korean traditional
          confectionery. During the Goryeo dynasty, sangchu ssam (wraps made with lettuce), yaksik, and yakgwa were
          developed, and since spread to China and other countries. Since the Joseon dynasty, Buddhist cuisine has been
          established in Korea according to regions and temples. On the other hand, royal court cuisine is closely
          related to Korean temple cuisine. In the past, when the royal court maids, sanggung, who were assigned to
          Suragan (hangul: 수라간; hanja: 水剌間; the name of the royal kitchen), where they prepared the king's meals, became
          old, they had to leave the royal palace. Therefore, many of them entered Buddhist temples to become nuns. As a
          result, culinary techniques and recipes of the royal cuisine were integrated into Buddhist cuisine.</p>

        <h3>Vegetarian cuisine</h3>
        <p>Vegetarian cookery in Korea may be linked to the Buddhist traditions that influenced Korean culture from the
          Goryeo dynasty onwards. There are hundreds of vegetarian restaurants in Korea, although historically they have
          been local restaurants that are unknown to tourists. Most have buffets, with cold food, and vegetarian kimchi
          and tofu being the main features. Bibimbap is a common vegan dish. Menus change with seasons. Wine with the
          alcohol removed and fine teas are also served. The Korean tea ceremony is suitable for all vegetarians and
          vegans, and began with Buddhist influences. All food is eaten with a combination of stainless steel oval
          chopsticks and a long-handled shallow spoon called together sujeo.</p>

        <h3>Ceremonial food</h3>
        <p>Food is an important part of traditions of Korean family ceremonies, which are mainly based on the Confucian
          culture. Gwan Hon Sang Je (관혼상제; 冠婚喪祭), the four family ceremonies (coming-of-age ceremony, wedding, funeral,
          and ancestral rite) have been considered especially important and elaborately developed, continuing to
          influence Korean life to these days. Ceremonial food in Korea has developed with variation across different
          regions and cultures. For example, rituals are mainly performed on the anniversary of deceased ancestors,
          called jesa. Ritual food include rice, liquor, soup, vinegar and soy sauce (1st row); noodles, skewered meat,
          vegetable and fish dishes, and rice cake (2nd row); three types of hot soup, meat and vegetable dishes (3rd
          row); dried snacks, kimchi, and sweet rice drink (4th row); and variety of fruit (5th row).</p>

        <h3>Street food</h3>
        <p>In South Korea, inexpensive food may be purchased from pojangmacha, street carts during the day, where
          customers may eat standing beside the cart or have their food wrapped up to take home. At night, pojangmacha
          (포장마차) become small tents that sell food, drinks, and alcoholic beverages. Seasonal street foods include
          hotteok, and bungeoppang, which are enjoyed in autumn and winter. Gimbap (김밥) and tteokbokki (떡볶이)are also
          very popular street food. People also enjoy to eat Sundae (순대), Twigim (튀김), and Eomuk (오뎅/어묵) which are
          popular with tteokbokki. Also, Gyeran-ppang (계란빵) which is Egg Bread and Hoppang (호빵) are also enjoyed in
          winter. Dak-kkochi (닭꼬치) is a popular food in Korea with various sauces on chicken. Beondegi (번데기) and
          dalgona/ppopgi (뽑기) are two examples of original street foods many people have enjoyed since childhood.</p>

        <h2>Etiquette</h2>
        <h3>Dining</h3>
        <p>Dining etiquette in Korea can be traced back to the Confucian philosophies of the Joseon period. Guidebooks,
          such as Sasojeol (士小節, Elementary Etiquette for Scholar Families), written in 1775 by Yi Deokmu (이덕무; 李德懋),
          comment on the dining etiquette for the period. Suggestions include items such as "when you see a fat cow,
          goat, pig, or chicken, do not immediately speak of slaughtering, cooking or eating it", "when you are having a
          meal with others, do not speak of smelly or dirty things, such as boils or diarrhea," "when eating a meal,
          neither eat so slowly as to appear to be eating against your will nor so fast as if to be taking someone
          else's food. Do not throw chopsticks on the table. Spoons should not touch plates, making a clashing sound",
          among many other recommendations which emphasized proper table etiquette. Other than the etiquette mentioned
          above, blowing one's nose when having a meal is considered an inappropriate act as well. The eldest male at
          the table was always served first, and was commonly served in the men's quarters by the women of the house.
          Women usually dined in a separate portion of the house after the men were served. The eldest men or women
          always ate before the younger family members. The meal was usually quiet, as conversation was discouraged
          during meals. In modern times, these rules have become lax, as families usually dine together now and use the
          time to converse. Of the remaining elements of this decorum, one is that the younger members of the table
          should not pick up their chopsticks or start eating before the elders of the table or guests and should not
          finish eating before the elders or guests finish eating. In Korea, unlike in other East Asian cuisines such as
          Chinese and Japanese, the rice or soup bowl is not lifted from the table when eating from it. This is due to
          the fact that each diner is given a metal spoon along with the chopsticks known collectively as sujeo. The use
          of the spoon for eating rice and soups is expected. There are rules which reflect the decorum of sharing
          communal side dishes; rules include not picking through the dishes for certain items while leaving others, and
          the spoon used should be clean, because usually diners put their spoons in the same serving bowl on the table.
          Diners should also cover their mouths when using a toothpick after the meal. The table setup is important as
          well, and individual place settings, moving from the diner's left should be as follows: rice bowl, spoon, then
          chopsticks. Hot foods are set to the right side of the table, with the cold foods to the left. Soup must
          remain on the right side of the diner along with stews. Vegetables remain on the left along with the rice, and
          kimchi is set to the back while sauces remain in the front.</p>

      <article class="blogposts">
        <h3>Drinking</h3>
        <p>The manner of drinking alcoholic drinks while dining is significant in Korean dining etiquette. Each diner is
          expected to face away from the eldest male and cover his mouth when drinking alcohol. According to Hyang Eum
          Ju Rye (향음주례; 鄕飮酒禮), the drinking etiquette established in Choseon dynasty, it is impolite for a king and his
          vassal, a father and his son, or a teacher and his student to drink face to face. Also, a guest should not
          refuse the first drink offered by host, and in the most formal situations, the diner should politely twice
          refuse a drink offered by the eldest male or a host. When the host offers for the third time, then finally the
          guest can receive it. If the guest refuses three times, drink is not to be offered any more.</p>

        <h2>Royal court cuisine</h2>
        <p>Collectively known as gungjung eumsik during the pre-modern era, the foods of the royal palace were
          reflective of the opulent nature of the past rulers of the Korean peninsula. This nature is evidenced in
          examples as far back as the Silla kingdom, where a man-made lake (Anapji Lake, located in Gyeongju), was
          created with multiple pavilions and halls for the sole purpose of opulent banquets, and a spring fed channel,
          Poseokjeong, was created for the singular purpose of setting wine cups afloat while they wrote poems.
          Reflecting the regionalism of the kingdoms and bordering countries of the peninsula, the cuisine borrowed
          portions from each of these areas to exist as a showcase. The royalty would have the finest regional
          specialties and delicacies sent to them at the palace. Although there are records of banquets predating the
          Joseon period, the majority of these records mostly reflect the vast variety of foods, but do not mention the
          specific foods presented. The meals cooked for the royal family did not reflect the seasons, as the commoner's
          meals would have. Instead, their meals varied significantly day-to-day. Each of the eight provinces was
          represented each month in the royal palace by ingredients presented by their governors, which gave the cooks a
          wide assortment of ingredients to use for royal meals. Food was considered significant in the Joseon period.
          Official positions were created within the Six Ministries (Yukjo, 육조) that were charged with all matters
          related to procurement and consumption of food and drink for the royal court. The Board of Personnel (Ijo, 이조)
          contained positions specific for attaining rice for the royal family. The Board of Rights (Yejo) were
          responsible for foods prepared for ancestor rites, attaining wines and other beverages, and medicinal foods.
          There were also hundreds of slaves and women who worked in the palace that had tasks such as making tofu,
          liquor, tea, and tteok (rice cakes). The women were the cooks to the royal palace and were of commoner or
          low-born families. These women would be split into specific skill sets or "bureau" such as the bureau of
          special foods (Saenggwa-bang, 생과방) or the bureau of cooking foods (Soju-bang, 소주방). These female cooks may
          have been assisted by male cooks from outside the palace during larger banquets when necessary. Five meals
          were generally served in the royal palace each day during the Joseon period, and records suggest this pattern
          had existed from antiquity. Three of these meals would be full meals, while the afternoon and after dinner
          meals would be lighter. The first meal, mieumsang (미음상), was served at sunrise and was served only on days
          when the king and queen were not taking herbal medicines. The meal consisted of rice porridge (juk, 죽) made
          with ingredients such as abalone (jeonbokjuk), white rice (huinjuk), mushrooms (beoseotjuk), pine nuts
          (jatjuk), and sesame (kkaejuk). The side dishes could consist of kimchi, nabak kimchi, oysters, soy sauce, and
          other items. The porridge was thought to give vitality to the king and queen throughout the day. The sura (수라)
          were the main meals of the day. Breakfast was served at ten in the morning, and the evening meals were served
          between six and seven at night. The set of three tables (surasang, 수라상), were usually set with two types of
          rice, two types of soup, two types of stew (jjigae), one dish of jjim (meat stew), one dish of jeongol (a
          casserole of meat and vegetables), three types of kimchi, three types of jang (장) and twelve side dishes,
          called 12 cheop (12첩). The meals were set in the suragan (수라간), a room specifically used for taking meals,
          with the king seated to the east and the queen to the west. Each had their own set of tables and were attended
          by three palace servant women known as sura sanggung (수라상궁). These women would remove bowl covers and offer
          the foods to the king and queen after ensuring the dishes were not poisoned. Banquets (궁중 연회 음식) were held on
          special occasions in the Korean Royal Palace. These included birthdays of the royal family members, marriages,
          and national festivals, including Daeborum, Dano, Chuseok, and Dongji. Banquet food was served on individual
          tables which varied according to the rank of the person. Usually banquet food consisted of ten different types
          of dishes. Main dishes were prepared based on the seasonal foods. Main dishes of the banquet included
          sinseollo, jeon, hwayang jeok, honghapcho, nengmyun and mulgimchi. A typical banquet ingredient was chogyetang
          (chicken broth with vinegar), which was prepared with five different chickens, five abalones, ten sea
          cucumbers, twenty eggs, half a bellflower root, mushrooms, two cups of black pepper, two peeled pine nuts,
          starch, soy sauce and vinegar. Yaksik was a favorite banquet dessert.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Chimaek (from chikin meaning "fried chicken", and maekju meaning "beer") is a pairing of fried chicken (such
          as
          plain and spicy) and beer, served with anju (side dishes, such as kimchi and mu) in the evening in many South
          Korean restaurants, including a number of specialazed chains. Modern chimaek is believed to have been invented
          in late 20th century, but it is hard to pinpoint the exact time and place. From the roasted chicken that
          appeared in the early 1960s to the spicy chicken that was adapted to meet Korean tastes, South Korea has
          imported and developed a growing variety of chicken dishes. While chicken was gaining popularity, a new draft
          beer which appeared in the 1970s was also becoming very popular, and it became common for the two to be
          combined
          as a single menu item. Demand for specialty chicken shops increased with the growing demands for chicken and
          beer. As of March 2014, Korea had 192 chicken franchise companies. About 10% of companies are known for unique
          recipes.</p>

        <p>Jeon (korean pancake) is a fritter in Korean cuisine made by seasoning whole, sliced, or minced fish, meat,
          vegetables, etc., and coating them with wheat flour and egg wash before frying them in oil. Jeon can be made
          with ingredients such as fish, meat, poultry, seafood, and vegetable, and be served as an appetizer, a banchan
          (side dish), or an anju (food served and eaten with drinks). Some jeon are sweet desserts; one such variety is
          called hwajeon (flower jeon).</p>

            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup ice water(240 mL), plus 2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>20 scallions, about 2 bunches, root trimmed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus 2-4 teaspoons</li>
            <li>¼ lb shrimp(105 g), peeled, deveined, and halved lengthwise (butterflied)</li>

          </ul>
          </p>
          <h4>Preparation</h4>
          <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Make the chili dipping sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together rice vinegar, sugar, garlic, and
              gochujang
              until smooth. Set aside until ready to use. The sauce will keep in an airtight container in the
              refrigerator
              for up to 1 week.</li>
            <li>Make the sesame soy garlic dipping sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil,
              rice
              vinegar, and sugar until the sugar dissolves. Add the scallions, garlic, and sesame seeds and whisk until
              well combined. Set aside until ready to use. The sauce will keep in an airtight container in the
              refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
            <li>Make the pancake batter: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt,
              garlic
              powder, onion powder, and black pepper. Stream in the ice water and whisk until the batter is smooth,
              about
              1 minute.</li>
            <li>Place the scallions in a large nonstick skillet to measure, then remove from the pan and trim so the
              scallions will lie flat in the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the skillet and heat over medium-low heat for 1–2 minutes. Arrange
              half
              of the trimmed scallions in a single layer in the skillet and cook for 1–2 minutes, until softened. Slowly
              pour about ½ cup batter over the scallions, ensuring that the batter gets between each scallion and to
              hold
              everything together.</li>
            <li>Immediately arrange half of the shrimp and half of the squid over the batter, distributing evenly. Pour
              another ¼ cup of the batter over the seafood, and let cook for 2–5 minutes, until the batter is starting
              to
              set. Carefully slide a spatula under the edge of the pancake and lift up to see if the underside of the
              pancake is turning golden brown. If it is starting to burn, reduce the heat to low.</li>
            <li>Add each egg to a small bowl with ¼ teaspoon salt each. Whisk with a fork to combine.</li>
            <li>When the pancake is mostly set on top, sprinkle with half of the red chile, then pour 1 beaten egg over
              the pancake. Cook for 2–4 minutes more, until the egg is mostly set.</li>
            <li>Quickly flip the pancake, then drizzle 1–2 teaspoons of vegetable oil around the edges of the pan to
              prevent sticking. Cook the pancake for 2–3 minutes more, until the egg is fully cooked and the bottom of
              the
              pancake is golden brown and crispy. Set a plate over the skillet and quickly invert the pancake onto the
              plate. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make another pancake.</li>
            <li>Slice the pancakes and serve with the dipping sauces.</li>

        <p>Korean BBQ (gogi-gu-i meaning "meat roast") refers to the popular method in Korean cuisine of grilling,
          typically beef, pork or chicken. Such dishes are often prepared on gas or charcoal grills built into the
          dining
          table itself. Some Korean restaurants that do not have built-in grills provide customers with portable stoves
          for diners to use at their tables. Alternatively, a chef uses a centrally displayed grill to prepare dishes to
          order. The most representative form of korean barbecue is bulgogi, usually made from thinly sliced marinated
          beef sirloin or tenderloin. Another popular form is galbi, made from marinated beef short ribs. However,
          korean
          barbecue also includes many other kinds of marinated and unmarinated meat dishes, and can be divided into
          several categories. Korean barbecue is popular in its home country, but has also gained popularity worldwide.

        <p>Grilled pork belly (samgyeopsal meaning "three-layer meat") or samgyeopsal-gui is a type of gui (grilled
          dish)
          in Korean cuisine. Thick, fatty slices of pork belly, sometimes with the skin left on and sometimes scored on
          the diagonal, are grilled on a slanted metal griddle or a gridiron at the diners' table, inset with charcoal
          grills or convex gas burners. Usually, diners grill the meat themselves, flipping and cutting them with tongs
          and scissors, and eat directly from the grill. The meat is usually neither marinated nor seasoned, although
          marinated samgyeopsal in flavors such as ginseng, wine, garlic, herbs, curry, doenjang, and gochujang has
          gained
          popularity since the late 2000s. Slices of garlic, onions, green chili peppers, mushrooms, and kimchi are
          often
          grilled alongside using the fat trickling from the pork belly. Common accompaniments for samgyeopsal include
          ssam vegetables such as lettuce, kkaennip (perilla leaves), ssammu (pickled radish paper) and dipping sauces
          such as ssamjang (made with seasoned mixture of chili paste and soy bean paste) and gireum-jang (made with
          sesame oil, salt, and black pepper), jangajji (soy sauce-pickled vegetables) such as myeongi-jangajji (pickled
          Siberian onion leaves) or yangpa-jangajji (pickled onions), kimchi, as well as sliced garlic, onions, and
          seasoned shredded scallions. Garlic, onions, and kimchi can be either grilled with the meat or consumed raw
          with
          the cooked meat. Mushrooms, such as button mushrooms or oyster mushrooms, are also grilled with the meat.</p>

        <p>Bokkeum-bap (fried rice) is a Korean dish made by stir-frying bap (cooked rice) with other ingredients in
          oil.
          The name of the most prominent ingredient other than cooked rice often appears at the very front of the name
          of
          the dish, as in kimchi-bokkeum-bap (kimchi fried rice). In Korean restaurants, fried rice is a popular
          end-of-meal add-on. Diners may say "bap bokka juseyo" (literally "Please fry rice.") after eating main dishes
          cooked on a tabletop stove, such as dak-galbi (spicy stir-fried chicken) or nakji-bokkeum (stir-fried
          octopus),
          then cooked rice along with gimgaru (seaweed flakes) and sesame oil will be added directly into the remains of
          the main dish, stir-fried and scorched.</p>

        <p>Bibimbap (mixed rice) is a Korean rice dish. The term "bibim" means mixing rice (burned rice at the bottom of
          the dish and cooked rice), while the "bap" noun refers to rice. Bibimbap is served as a bowl of warm white
          rice
          topped with namul (sautéed and seasoned vegetables) or kimchi (traditional fermented vegetables) and gochujang
          (chili pepper paste), soy sauce, or doenjang (a fermented soybean paste). A raw or fried egg and sliced meat
          (usually beef) are common additions. The hot dish is stirred together thoroughly just before eating. In South
          Korea, Jeonju, Jinju, and Tongyeong are especially famous for their versions of bibimbap. In 2011, the dish
          was listed at number 40 on the World's 50 most delicious foods readers' poll compiled by CNN Travel.</p>

            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
          </ul>
          For Serving
          <ul>
            <li>sushi rice, cooked</li>
            <li>1 cup cabbage kimchi(150 g)</li>
            <li>persian cucumber, thinly sliced</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h4>Preparation</h4>
          <p>
          <ol>
            <li>In a shallow dish, combine 2 cloves of garlic, the ginger, 2 thinly sliced scallions, the soy sauce, 2
              tablespoons sesame oil, the mirin, and brown sugar, and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator for 30
              minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat and season generously with salt. Prepare an ice bath
              in
              a large bowl. Blanch the spinach in the boiling water for 30 seconds, then transfer to the ice bath to
              shock, then drain. Transfer to a small bowl and season with 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, salt, and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>In a medium skillet, heat 1 teaspoon of sesame oil over medium heat. Add the carrots and cook until
              softened, 2-3 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside. Season with salt.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of sesame oil over medium-high heat. Add the remaining clove of
              garlic and cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until
              softened, about 2 minutes. Season with salt, then remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of sesame oil over medium-high heat. Add the
              marinated
              chicken and sauté, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Melt the butter in the pan. Once the foaming subsides, crack
              the eggs into the pan and cook until the whites are firm and golden brown around the edges and the yolks
              are
              still runny, or to your desired doneness.</li>
            <li>To assemble the bibimbap bowls, top the rice with the chicken, kimchi, sliced scallions, carrots,
              spinach,
              mushrooms, cucumbers, and fried eggs.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>

        <p>Tteokbokki (simmered rice cake), is a popular Korean food made from small-sized garae-tteok (long, white,
          cylinder-shaped rice cakes) called tteokmyeon (rice cake noodles) or commonly tteokbokki-tteok (tteokbokki
          rice
          cakes). Eomuk (fish cakes), boiled eggs, and scallions are some common ingredients paired with tteokbokki in
          dishes. It can be seasoned with either spicy gochujang (chili paste) or non-spicy ganjang (soy sauce)-based
          sauce; the former is the most common form, while the latter is less common and sometimes called
          gungjung-tteokbokki (royal court tteokbokki). Today, variations also include curry-tteokbokki, cream
          sauce-tteokbokki, jajang-tteokbokki, seafood-tteokbokki, rose-tteokbokki, galbi-tteokbokki and so on.
          Tteokbokki
          is commonly purchased and eaten at bunsikjip (snack bars) as well as pojangmacha (street stalls). There are
          also
          dedicated restaurants for tteokbokki, where it is referred to as jeukseok tteokbokki (impromptu tteokbokki).
          It
          is also a popular home dish, as the rice cakes (garae-tteok) can be purchased in pre-packaged, semi-dehydrated
          form.</p>

        <p> Jjigae (korean stew) is a soup with many varieties; it is typically made with meat, seafood or vegetables in
          a
          broth seasoned with gochujang, doenjang, ganjang or saeujeot. Jjigae is usually served in a communal dish,
          boiling hot. A Korean meal almost always includes either a jjigae or a guk. During the Joseon dynasty, it was
          known as jochi, and two varieties would always be present on the King's surasang. The types of jjigae are
          often
          named according to their principal ingredients, such as saengseon jjigae made from fish or dubu jjigae made
          from
          tofu, or according to their broth and seasonings like gochujang jjigae or doenjang jjigae.</p>
