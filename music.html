      <h3>Korean Voice</h3>
      <p>Korean folk music or minyo, is varied and complex, but all forms maintain a set of rhythms (Jangdan) and a
        loosely defined
        set of melodic modes owing to diverse instruments, while even drums were eligible to demonstrate variety of
        rhythmic cycles.
        Because the folk songs of various areas are categorized under Dongbu folk songs, their vocal styles and modes
        are limited.
        Therefore, currently, scholars are attempting to categorize the Dongbu folk songs further, based on different
        musical
        features. These songs are mostly simple and bright. Namdo folk songs are those of Jeolla Province and a part of
        Chungcheong
        Province. While the folk songs of other regions are mostly musically simple, the folk songs of the Namdo region,
        where
        the famous musical genres pansori and sanjo were created, are rich and dramatic. Some Namdo folk songs are used
        in pansori
        or developed by professional singers and are included as part of their repertories. Jeju folk songs are sung on
        Jeju Island.
        Jeju folk songs are more abundant in number than any other regional folk songs, and approximately 1600 songs are
        transmitted
        today. Jeju folk songs are characterized by their simple and unique melodic lines and rich texts.</p>
      <h4>Pansori</h4>
      <p>Pansori is a long vocal and percussive music played by one singer and 1 drummer. In this traditional art form,
        sometimes
        rather misleadingly called 'Korean Opera', a narrator may play the parts of all the characters in a story,
        accompanied
        by a drummer. The lyrics tell one of five different stories, but is individualized by each performer, often with
        updated
        jokes and audience participation. One of the most famous pansori singers is Park Dongjin. In 2003, Pansori was
        designated
        as intangible cultural property in UNESCO's Memory of the world. The National Theatre of Korea provides monthly
        opportunities
        to experience traditional Korean narrative songs or Pansori.</p>
      <h4>Pungmul</h4>
      <p>Pungmul is a Korean folk music tradition that is a form of percussion music that includes drumming, dancing,
        and singing.
        Most performances are outside, with dozens of players, all in constant motion. Samul Nori, originally the name
        of a musical
        group founded in 1978, has become popular as a genre, even overseas. It is based on Pungmul musical rhythmic
        patterns
        and uses the same instruments, but is faster and usually played while sitting down.</p>
      <h4>Sanjo</h4>
      <p>Sanjo is played without a pause in faster tempos as one of the most popular genres of traditional Korean music.
        It is
        entirely instrumental music, and includes changes in rhythmic and melodic modes during an individual work. The
        tempo increases
        in each movement. The general style of the sanjo is marked by slides in slow movements and rhythmic complexity
        in faster
        movements. Instruments include the changgo drum set against a melodic instrument, such as the gayageum or
        ajaeng. Famous
        practitioners include such names as Kim Chukp'a, Yi Saenggang and Hwang Byungki. Notably Hwang established new
        type of
        sanjo genre which involved in repertory of gayageum on the basis of aiming to identify and explain distinctive
        musical
        features and creativity.</p>
      <h4>Jeongak</h4>
      <p>Jeongak or Chongak means literally "right (or proper) music", and its tradition includes both instrumental and
        vocal
        music, which were cultivated mainly by the upper-class literati of the Joseon society. The instrumental branch
        has several
        versions of a lengthy chamber, chiefly Yongsan hoesang, while the vocal branch sometimes include the meaning of
        jeongga
        (Right Song) with a wide range of gagok, gasa, and sijo. Although jeongak has things in common with court music
        but it
        can't be categorized as popular song since most public would never hear of these melodies by incorporating
        various court
        dances. Vocals performed in jeongak are normally sung in a style of kagok, which is for mixed male and female
        singers
        and is accompanied by a variety of instruments. The best-known piece of jeongak is Yeongsan hoesang of 9 suites
        which
        has now had only instrumental notes.</p>
      <h4>Nongak</h4>
      <p>Nongak refers to "farmers' music" and represents an important musical genre which has been developed mainly by
        peasants
        in the agricultural society of Korea. The farmers' music is performed typically in an open area of the village.
        The organization
        of nongak varies according to locality and performing groups, and today there are a great number of regional
        styles and
        involvement of many instruments. Since Nongak involves in many types of dances and formation changes, the
        dancers and
        players have several types of artistic format due to their level of skill.</p>
      <h4>Shinawi</h4>
      <p>Shinawi or Sinawi, means, in the broadest sense, the shamanistic music of Korea which is performed during a
        Korean shaman's
        ritual dance performance to console and to entertain deities mainly from Korea's southwest region. In this sense
        of the
        word, the term is almost identical with another term, shinbanggok (lit. 'spirit chamber music'), which indicated
        general
        shamanistic music performed at a folk religious ceremony known as kut. The format of this genre is comparatively
        loose
        with several dancers being united and dispersed on the stage.</p>
      <h4>Salpuri</h4>
      <p>Salpuri is a shamanistic ritual dance, conducted as exorcism of bad ghosts. The style of this ritual dance is
        characterized
        simple and serene. The long scarf with fluid lines express long lines of the arms and fingers of the dancer from
        corner
        to corner of the space, utilizing the vastness of space all the way.</p>

      <h3>Court/Ritual music</h3>
      <p>Korean court music preserved to date can be traced to the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392. It is now
        rare, except
        for government-sponsored organizations like The National Center for Korean Traditional Performing
        Arts.<br><br>There are three types of court music.
      <ul>
        <li>Aak is an imported form of Chinese ritual music.</li>
        <li>Hyang-ak is a Pure Korean form.</li>
        <li>Dang-ak is a combination of Korean and Chinese influences.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>Aak</h4>
      <p>The word Aak is the Korean pronunciation of two hanja characters, which indicate the equivalent form of yayue
        in Chinese and gagaku in Japan. Since Confucius used this term to distinguish elegant and beneficial music from
        the melodies without harmony, it enjoyed favorable status during Joseon. Derived from wider types of notations,
        Korea has maintained its melodies until now of which features were long lost in China. Aak is considered a
        special type of court music in specific ritual ceremonies at very rare concerts, such as the Sacrifice to
        Confucius in Seoul.</p>
      <h4>Dang-ak</h4>
      <p>Dangak or Tangak refers to the music which came from the Tang dynasty. The instruments from Tang were imported.
        During the 12th century, Korea received musical instruments as gifts from the Chinese ruler, which were used by
        the orchestra at Confucian rituals. These influences provided Unified Silla with robust opportunities to develop
        its music culture after Korean performers' visits to China and vice versa Chinese performers visited Korea in
        1116.</p>
      <h4>Hyang-ak</h4>
      <p>Hyangak literally means The local music or Music native to Korea of which one example is Sujecheon, a piece of
        instrumental music as old as 1,300 years. Hyangak firstly appeared as early as during Silla period with four
        ensemble stringed instrument with woodwind instruments similar to the oboe, called a piri. Pares and English
        indicate the texts of Goryeosa: The most significant dates for music hyangak (indigenous music; other texts
        refer to this as sogak) were 1114 and 1116, when the court received two gifts from the eighth Song emperor,
        Huizong. Korea was fast becoming a Confucian state and kings had begun to observe Confucian rites to heaven, to
        agriculture, land and grain, and to royal ancestors. Yongbieocheonga, Songs of the Dragons Flying to Heaven
        represents its uniqueness as hyangak, which was originally tuned to various notes and lyrics but the text was
        lost and purely instrument rhythm left.</p>

      <h3>Contemporary music</h3>
      <p>Korea is a vibrant environment for contemporary music, and produces a wide array of styles. The country has
        produced internationally prominent soloists and acts such as Psy, BoA, Rain, IU, Epik High, Wonder Girls, 2AM,
        2PM, Blackpink, TVXQ, Super Junior, Girls' Generation, SHINee, EXO, Big Bang, 2NE1, Seventeen, Momoland, Twice,
        GOT7, BTS, Monsta X, The Boyz, and NCT, with the music becoming a worldwide phenomenon. Blackpink has made
        history on the Billboard's charts, as, among other feats, the all-female quartet debuts the highest-charting hit
        ever by a K-pop girl group on the Billboard Hot 100, with "DDU-DU DDU-DU" opening at No. 55 (on the chart dated
        June 30). Their music, though often electronic pop, hip-hop and/or R&B in essence, is generally grouped under a
        genre called K-pop, which emerged during the 1990s and has since become increasingly and continuously popular as
        part of the Korean Wave.</p>
